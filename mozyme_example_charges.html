<b>
MOZYME: Identifying Charged Sites</b></h1>
<p align="left">
Finding all the charged sites in a large molecule is tedious, and if done by 
hand, is prone to errors.&nbsp; If the charge calculated by MOZYME does not 
match the charge supplied in the data set (either zero, if charge=n is absent, 
or n, if charge=n is supplied), then the calculated Lewis structure will be 
printed along with a list of the charged sites found when the Lewis structure 
was generated.&nbsp; In some cases a charged atom will be different to that expected.&nbsp; Thus 
in a charged arginine residue, the ionized site might be expected to be a 
nitrogen, but another valid Lewis structure  puts the charge on the  carbon atom 
that is bonded to the three nitrogen atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p><p>Checking all the ionized sites in a protein is important before any modeling 
work is started.</p>
<p>Sometimes <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> generates an&nbsp; incorrect Lewis 
structure.&nbsp; For example, if the system C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 
is supplied, this being a hexagon of carbon atoms with an oxygen atom at 
positions 1 and 4, hydrogen atoms being at the other positions, MOZYME will 
generate the Lewis structure for <i>para</i>-benzoquinone.&nbsp; But the user 
might have wanted to calculate the di-anion of <i>para</i>-hydroquinone.&nbsp; 
Since this has two negative charges, the keyword <a href="charge.html"><tt>CHARGE=-2</tt></a> would have been used.&nbsp; 
If an incorrect charge, and by implication, an incorrect Lewis structure is 
generated by MOZYME, the fault can be corrected using two methods.</p>
<p><b>Use of atom labels</b></p>
<p>A unit charge can be assigned to individual atoms using <a href="Labels.html">
atom labels</a>.&nbsp; In the case of the di-anion of <i>para</i>-hydroquinone, 
both oxygen atoms could be given the label "(-)" to indicate that they are 
anions.&nbsp; This would result in the correct Lewis structure for the di-anion of <i>para</i>-hydroquinone 
being generated.</p>
<p>Another less critical but still informative example is N-methyl para-hydroxy pyridine 
with the hydrogen atom deleted.&nbsp; Its default Lewis structure results in a neutral 
nitrogen and neutral oxygen.&nbsp; If the more conventional Zwitterionic form is 
wanted, then the nitrogen atom would need to be labeled "(+)" and the oxygen 
atom "(-)".&nbsp; Both charges need to be defined; if only one of these labels 
was used then the resulting structure would be faulty.&nbsp; Here is the data 
set for this system:</p>

Sometimes, very rarely, a chemical system has more than one valid Lewis 
structure.&nbsp; There are trivial examples, such as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, 
where the net formal charge can be inferred from the net charge on the system 
and the other charges that are present.&nbsp; More serious are systems such as 
1,1'-dialkane-4,4'-bipyridinium.&nbsp; If the only information available was the 
topographic structure, then the simplest Lewis structure would be the neutral 
system shown in the figure.&nbsp; In order to generate the correct Lewis 
structure, extra information has to be provided.&nbsp; In this case, the extra 
information would consist of the formal charge on the nitrogen atoms.&nbsp; Use 
the data set to explore this system.</p>

<p><b>User-modified topology</b></p>
<p>Individual bonds can be added or removed (using <a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a>) 
in order to create a topology that would give rise to the desired Lewis 
structure.&nbsp; This option will most commonly be used when metal complexes are 
present. Thus if a zinc atom has four ligands, it will be given a formal charge 
of -2 and an oxidation state of +2.&nbsp; Although this is completely valid as a 
Lewis structure, some users might be concerned at this unusual formal charge.&nbsp; 
By selectively removing Zn-ligand bonds, the more conventional Lewis structure 
can be generated.</p>
<p>In the unlikely situation that the desired Lewis structure cannot be 
generated, please send details to SCC.</p>
