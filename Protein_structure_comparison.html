<p>
Two protein structures can be compared to show their similarity and the 
differences.&nbsp; The second of the two proteins is rotated and translated so 
as to minimize the Root Mean Square (RMS) difference between it and the first 
geometry.&nbsp; If swapping pairs of atoms would reduce the RMS error, this is 
done. Differences are represented three ways. The simplest is to generate a list 
of atoms that have the largest difference in position; this is of limited use 
because some parts of a protein are very flexible, i.e. large geometric changes 
might be accompanied by only very small changes in energy.&nbsp; A more 
important type of difference involves changes in bond-lengths.&nbsp; Because 
covalent bonds have high force-constants, any significant change in bond length 
indicates a significant change in the local energy environment.&nbsp; The third 
measure of difference is change in hydrogen bond energies.&nbsp; In individual 
proteins there are often hundreds of hydrogen bonds, and the formation or loss 
of even a single one of these can change the heat of formation by several 
kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>, so information about the creation or loss of a hydrogen 
bond can focus attention on possible problems in a structure.</p>

<a name="What_it_can_do">What it can do</a> (<a href="#Protein_Structure_Comparison">top</a>)</h2>
<p>
Given two PDB files that represent the same protein, or two similar proteins, a 
structure comparison starts by identifying those atoms that are common to both 
systems.&nbsp; Atoms that are in one but not the other system are identified and 
not used.&nbsp; The remaining atoms are superimposed so as to minimize the RMS 
difference, and lists of the three types of differences printed.&nbsp; A simple 
web-page is then written that allows the two superimposed systems to be 
visualized using JSmol.&nbsp; With the three lists of differences and the JSmol 
graphics, the nature of the differences between the two systems can be quickly 
understood.</p>
<h2>
<a name="How_to_do_it">How to do it</a> (<a class="auto-style3" href="#Protein_Structure_Comparison">top</a>)</h2>
<p>
The recommended method for comparing protein structures is to use a two-line 
data-set.&nbsp; As with most MOPAC data-sets, the first line consists of 
keywords; the second line, although optional, is strongly recommended, and 
should be a description of the two structures being compared.</p>
<p>
On the first line, and for the most concise and informative results, use the set of keywords 
"<a href="geo_dat.html"><tt>GEO_DAT="text"</tt></a> <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF="text"</tt></a>
<a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>
<a href="geo-ok.html"><tt>GEO-OK</tt></a> <a href="output.html"><tt>OUTPUT</tt></a>".&nbsp; Their significance in this 
procedure is:</p>
<h3>
<tt>GEO_DAT="text"</tt> </h3>
<p>
The first of the two geometries is specified.&nbsp; 
This geometry can be a MOPAC data set, an ARC file, or a PDB file, either 
straight from the Protein Data Bank, or an edited PDB file, or a PDB file made 
by MOPAC.&nbsp; This keyword is not essential, in that the first geometry could 
be placed after the normal first three lines.&nbsp; However, using the keyword 
allows an un-edited protein geometry to be read in.&nbsp; Within the comparison 
procedure, the first of the two geometries will not be modified, that is, the 
atom-sequence will not be changed, although some atoms might be deleted in order 
to have a match with the second geometry, nor will the atomic coordinates be 
changed. This shows up in the results only; the file read in is not affected at 
all.</p>
<h4>
Atoms Deleted:</h4>
<p>
First, all atoms that have the same name, residue, chain, and residue number are 
retained. Of the remaining atoms, all 
hydrogen atoms are selected.&nbsp; Within this set, if two hydrogen atoms have 
the same residue, chain letter, and residue number, then the atoms are retained.&nbsp; All 
remaining atoms will be deleted, unless <a href="geo-ok.html"><tt>GEO-OK+</tt></a> is also 
present, in which case all remaining hydrogen atoms are paired up.&nbsp; This 
last option is only useful when a salt-bridge exists in only one of the two 
structures, in which case its atom label will refer to one residue in one 
structure and a different residue in the other. </p>
<p>
The first geometry can be regarded as the reference geometry for the purposes of 
comparing structures.</p>
<h3>
<tt>GEO_REF="text"</tt></h3>
<p>
&nbsp;The second of the two geometries is specified. Within the comparison 
procedure, the this geometry will be modified so that the RMS difference between 
it and the reference geometry is minimized.&nbsp; This might require that the 
sequence of atoms might be changed, some atoms might be deleted and the atomic 
coordinates will certainly be changed.</p>
<h4>
Changes to Atom Sequence: </h4>
By convention, most atoms in a PDB file will be in a precisely defined position, 
the commonest exception occurring in residues in which there is an unavoidable 
ambiguity in the order of the atoms.&nbsp; For example, in phenylalanine C<sub><span class="auto-style1">d</span>1</sub> 
and C<sub><span class="auto-style1">d</span>2</sub> can be interchanged (swapped 
around) and the system could still comply with the PDB convention. Pairs of 
atoms of this type will be interchanged if that would result in the RMS 
difference between the two structures being reduced.

<p>
If, when there are two or more entire protein chains present, and the chains are 
in a different sequence from that in the reference geometry, then the chains 
will be re-arranged to suit the reference geometry.&nbsp; The same will be done 
with hetero groups and ligands: they will be re-arranged to suit that in the 
reference geometry.</p>
<h3>
<tt>0SCF</tt>&nbsp; and
<tt>HTML</tt> </h3>
<p>
The presence of both keywords
<tt>0SCF</tt>  and
<tt>HTML</tt> indicates that the job is not to continue, and that after the two 
structures have been compared the job is to stop.</p>
<h3>
<tt>GEO-OK</tt> </h3>
<p>
This keyword is optional here.&nbsp; By default, if there are any atoms in one 
system that are not present in the other system, no comparison will be made.&nbsp; 
Instead, the differences will be printed and the job stopped.&nbsp; If
<tt>GEO-OK</tt> is present, then the systems will be trimmed so that only those 
atoms that are common to both systems are retained.&nbsp; These will then be 
used in the comparison.</p>
<h3>
<tt>OUTPUT</tt></h3>
<p>
This keyword is optional here, but is strongly recommended.&nbsp; When
<tt>OUTPUT</tt> is present, the large lists of atomic data are not generated; 
this makes reading the output file much easier.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
<a name="Caveats">Caveats</a> (<a href="#Protein_Structure_Comparison">top</a>)</h2>
<p>
When comparing similar PDB structures that include water molecules, there is a 
high probability that the residue sequence numbers will be different in the two 
systems.&nbsp; Unless the water molecules are deleted, the resulting RMS 
difference between the two structures will be artificially high. </p>
<p>
If the name of the substrate, if present, is different in the two systems, then 
the substrate will be removed automatically.&nbsp; To prevent this, use the 
keywords <tt><a href="residues.html">RESIDUES0</a> </tt>and <tt>
<a href="xeno.html">XENO</a></tt>.&nbsp; This will allow the atom-labels in the first 
geometry to be modified to suit the second geometry.&nbsp; If the first geometry is not a PDB file, other keywords, specifically 
<tt><a href="start_res.html">START_RES</a></tt> and <tt><a href="chains.html">CHAINS</a></tt> will likely be needed in order to preserve the other 
atom-labels.</p>
