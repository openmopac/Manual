<font face="Arial" size="5">The Problem</font></b></u></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5"><font face="Arial" size="4">Computing the 
relative binding energy of ligands non-covalently 
bound to  proteins requires achieving an unusually high accuracy.&nbsp; This 
requirement is essential when calculating the binding ability of various 
ligands, in particular candidate therapeutic drugs.&nbsp; If the modifications 
described below are made then an estimate of the accuracy in computed binding 
energies that can be expected is as follows:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li dir="ltr"><p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
<font face="Arial" size="4">Errors in the interaction energies between the 
  ligand and the protein.&nbsp; Over a range of types of interaction energies 
  the
  <a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Statistics%20for%20Intermolecular%20interactions.html">
  Average Unsigned Error</a> relative to very high-quality calculations is 1.72 
  kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for PM6-D3H4 and 2.91 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for PM7. If 
the set S12L, a severe test of non-covalent intereactions, is removed, the AUE's 
drop to 1.04 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for PM6-D3H4 and to 1.34 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> 
for PM7.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
<font face="Arial" size="4">Incomplete geometry optimization would cause errors 
of about 1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>.</font></p></li>

</ol>
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
<font face="Arial" size="4">Using these data an estimate of the average 
  unsigned error in the relative binding energy of the ligand non-covalently bound to a 
  protein is about 2 to 3 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, provided, and this is a big 
  qualification, the errors in 3 are small. Errors in the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
  of the protein obviously cancel out, but errors in the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the 
  ligand in solution are more problematic.&nbsp; Specifically, the
  <a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Notes_on_Proteins.html#Other_faults">
  known error in PM6</a> that under-estimates steric repulsion between 
  non-covalently bound atoms can compromise the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the ligand in 
  solution.</font><p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5"><font face="Arial" size="4">
The problems with conventional calculation options are as follows:</font></p>
<h2 align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5"><font face="Arial" size="4">
The systems are large and multiple minima exist</font></h2>
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5"><font face="Arial" size="4">If 
an entire protein is used then almost always a severe problem is encountered in 
the geometry optimization that prevents the necessary high accuracy in energies from being 
achieved.&nbsp; 
This problem is a direct consequence of the very large number of local minima on 
the potential energy surface (PES) and is common to all complicated systems such as proteins; 
it has nothing to do with the optimization procedure or with the underlying 
method.&nbsp; When a geometry is optimized the 
procedure used moves the atomic coordinates in a downhill direction on the PES. 
This process terminates when no further decrease in heat of formation (&Delta;H<sub>f</sub>) 
can be achieved. Minor changes in the starting geometry can give rise to a 
different path being followed, resulting in a different minima being reached. 
These minima can differ in &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> by several kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and, 
although these minima might look correct, any conclusions drawn from the various &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
would almost certainly be untrustworthy.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="4">Both PM6 and PM7 methods and their modifications 
have errors</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">PM6 should never be used on its own because, it 
severely underestimates dispersion effects and hydrogen bonds and as a result it 
is essentially useless for predicting non-covalent interactions, Instead always 
use PM6-D3H4 or PM6-D3H4X.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, the underlying PM6 
method has two known errors, involving spurious sulfur - oxygen and sulfur - 
nitrogen interactions, see
<a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Notes_on_Proteins.html#Known%20faults">
details.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">PM7 has one severe error, a spurious chlorine - 
nitrogen non-covalent interaction. This interaction results in an excess 
stabilization of about 11 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> in chlorine-containing ligands 
non-covalently bound to proteins.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="4">Incomplete geometry optimization results in 
large errors</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Although the default geometry optimizer for large 
systems, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS">L-BFGS</a> 
optimizer, is the most efficient optimizer in MOPAC, at the end of an 
optimization this procedure has difficulty locating the energy minimum, and it 
often terminates several kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> above the lowest point.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="5">Suggested modifications</font></b></u></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="4">Multiple minima</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">This procedure is only recommended for proteins 
that do not exhibit allosteric behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Two steps are recommended.&nbsp; In the first 
step protein-ligand docking software, e.g.,
<a href="https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-discovery/components/gold/">
GOLD</a>, should be used to generate a number of candidate conformations of a 
ligand docked into a protein. In the second step all of the protein far from the 
ligand is deleted from the system being modeled. This reduces the size of the 
system to only the region of interest, this region will be referred to as a 
<a href="Use%20of%20a%20globule.html">
Globule</a>. When a Globule is used most of the minima are automatically excluded.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">
<h2><font size="4">Errors in methods</font></h2>
<p>PM6-D3H4 errors: Unless any sulfur atoms are near to the site of interest and 
when the globule geometry is optimized a severe distortion occurs, this error is 
unimportant and can be ignored.&nbsp; If corrective action is needed, then the 
appropriate interatomic separation should be fixed, i.e., not allowed to 
optimize. Alternatively, and more easily implemented, use PM7 instead of 
PM6-D3H4.</p>
<p>PM7 error: If any chlorine atoms are involved in the ligand - protein 
interaction, don't use PM7; use PM6-D3H4 instead.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Incomplete geometry optimization</font></h2>
<p>This fault can be completely eliminated by using <a href="let.html">LET(<i>nnn</i>)</a>, 
where <i>nnn</i> is large.&nbsp; A good value for <i>nnn</i> is 250. This significantly 
increases the time required for the optimization, but the results are 
considerably more reliable.</p>
<p><b>Surveys</b></p>
<p>Working with ligands involves large numbers of jobs, typically the number of 
ligands times the number of poses from the docking program, so to minimize the 
possibility of making a typographic error as many steps in preparing and running 
a job as possible should be automated.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5"><b>Suggestions for running 
surveys that use a Globule:</b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
Use the <a href="setup.html">SETUP</a> keyword to supply all the keywords. If a 
change needs to be made to the keywords only one file, the setup file, need be 
edited.</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
Usually many 
  different ligands and poses are used, so that a large number of jobs need to be 
  run, in which case additional useful keywords are <a href="threads.html">THREADS=1</a>, 
  <a href="dump.html">DUMP=2D</a>.&nbsp; These 
  keywords improve performance when many jobs are run simultaneously in a 
  batch queue.&nbsp; THREADS=1 turns off multi-threading inside MOPAC.&nbsp; 
  When the number of jobs that can be run simultaneously equals the number of 
  threads, each job uses one thread, so the system overhead is almost zero.&nbsp; 
  In the unlikely event of a computer crashing, it is possible to restart 
  individual jobs that were killed by the crash if a <a href="restart.html">RESTART</a> file exists.&nbsp; 
  But doing this involves some typing, an error-prone operation,  a simpler option is to ignore 
  the RESTART files and just re-run any jobs that were killed.&nbsp; To stop 
  RESTART files from being written, add DUMP=2D.&nbsp; This effectively turns off the  default two-hour dump.&nbsp; </p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
Use macros to construct the jobs and to run them.&nbsp; There is a very high 
probability of making errors if macros are not used.&nbsp; When writing macros, 
carefully label the various jobs, both in the job-name and in the job-title. For 
example, if there are 50 ligands, labeled ligand-1 to ligand-50, and 10 poses 
for each ligand, then job-names such as L1-5 might be used. This would indicate 
that the system is Ligand-1 in Pose 5.&nbsp; Try to use short job-names, and use 
the folder name to specify the survey</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
Run the survey.</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
Again, use macros to analyze the results.&nbsp; 
  These macros should search the various ARC files to find the heat of formation 
  and, optionally, the gradient norm.</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
If there is any doubt about the system being at a minimum, re-run all the 
systems but start with the protein geometry from the system that is most stable, 
i.e., has the largest stabilization energy. If the stabilization energy 
increases, then replace the old systems with the new ones. If thought necessary, 
this step could be repeated until the stabilization energy is a maximum for each 
system.</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p align="left" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.5">
When all systems are at their most stable, a useful operation is to
<a href="compare.html"><tt>COMPARE</TT></a> the different systems to see what 
the differences are, for example large differences in protein geometry would be 
expected near the ligand, and small differences would be expected near the 
surface of the Globule.</p></li>
