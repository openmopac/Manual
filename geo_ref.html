<tt>GEO_REF="<i>text</i>"</tt> </h1>
<font face="Arial"> <tt>GEO_REF</tt> supplies a second geometry to a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
more than one line of keywords is supplied, then this keyword should be on the 
first line.

<p>There are two ways to specify "<em>text</em>" :</p>
<p>(A) Specify the file name and location, e.g.:</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial"> <tt>GEO_REF="CRAMBIN 1CBN X-ray.mop</tt>"<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="CRAMBIN.arc</tt>" <br/><tt>GEO_REF="CRAMBIN.pdb</tt>" </font> <br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="./CRAMBIN.arc</tt>"<br/><tt>GEO_REF="../CRAMBIN.arc</tt>"
<br/><tt>GEO_REF="../<font face="Arial"><tt>../arc files/C</tt></font>RAMBIN.arc</tt>" <br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="sub folder/CRAMBIN.arc</tt>"
<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF<font face="Arial"><tt>=</tt></font>"./sub 
folder/CRAMBIN.arc</tt>"<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="M:\data sets\CRAMBIN 1CBN X-ray.mop</tt>"<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="/Users/jstewart/data_sets/CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop</tt>"<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="~/data_sets/CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop</tt>"</p>
<p>(B) Use &nbsp; <tt>
GEO_REF="SELF".&nbsp;</tt>When "SELF" 
is present, a file that has the same name as the MOPAC data-set can be used.&nbsp; 
By default, this data-set would be the data-set in the current job.&nbsp; An 
alternative would be to use a data-set in a different folder, for example:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><tt>GEO_REF="../<font face="Arial"><tt>Reference geometry/SELF</tt></font></tt>"
<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="../<font face="Arial"><tt>../arc files/SELF</tt></font></tt>"
<tt>
<br/>
<tt>GEO_REF="<font face="Arial"><tt>C:/PM6 geometries/Self</tt></font></tt>"
</tt> </p>
<p dir="ltr">If desired, the suffix can be changed, so if the data-set suffix is 
".mop" and the file that is to be used as the
<tt>GEO_REF</tt> file has the suffix ".arc", then replace "<tt><font face="Arial"><tt>SELF</tt></font></tt>"&nbsp; 
with "<tt><font face="Arial"><tt>SELF.arc</tt></font></tt>"&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">
If <tt>GEO_REF="SELF"</tt> is used, then the GEO_REF geometry used will be the one defined in the 
MOPAC data-set, even if <a href="restart.html"><tt>RESTART</tt></a> is also present.&nbsp; That is, the 
GEO_REF geometry used will be the geometry before any changes caused by <tt>RESTART</tt> 
are applied.&nbsp; This allows large systems to be restarted easily.</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial"> <tt>GEO_REF</tt>&nbsp; can be used for 
<a href="compare.html">comparing geometries</a>, improving X-ray geometries and 
also for locating 
transition states (using <a href="Locate-TS.html"><tt>LOCATE-TS</tt></a> or
<a href="saddle.html"><tt>SADDLE</tt></a>).

In all cases, the job uses two geometries, one from the data set or defined 
using <a href="geo_dat.html"><tt>GEO_DAT</tt></a>, and one from a 
second data set defined by the keyword  <tt>
GEO_REF.</tt></font> By default, the <tt>GEO_REF</tt> system will be rotated and 
translated to minimize the difference between it and the <tt>GEO_DAT</tt> 
geometry.&nbsp; This operation will not be carried out if keyword <a href="noreor.html"><tt>NOREOR</tt></a> 
is present.&nbsp; This allows a strict comparison of closely-related systems in 
which some atoms are frozen. </p><p>
If the file containing the geometry also contains keywords, job name, etc. these 
will be ignored.&nbsp; Only the keywords, job name, etc., in the MOPAC data set, 
i.e., the file containing
<font face="Arial">
<tt>GEO_REF=&lt;text&gt;</tt></font>, will be used.&nbsp; Some keywords, such as
<a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a>, may also require <a href="geo-ok.html"><tt>GEO-OK</tt></a>.</p><p>
<font face="Arial"> Both systems will be converted to simple Cartesian 
coordinates.&nbsp;
</font>
Any dummy atoms supplied in either the first system or the system defined by 
<tt>GEO_REF</tt> will be ignored, as will any translation vectors.&nbsp; </p><h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <font face="Arial"> MOPAC data sets must contain PDB information.&nbsp; </font>Before any calculation is started, the two data sets are examined and 
compared.&nbsp; <font face="Arial"> For both PDB files and for MOPAC data sets, t</font>he examination consists of checking that every atom has a 
unique label.&nbsp;If any of the following strict requirements is not 
met,
<font face="Arial"> an error message printed and</font> the job will be stopped:</p><ul>
<li>Both species must have the same empirical formula</li>
<li>For PDB files and for MOPAC files with PDB information, all atom labels must be unique. Atom numbers don't count towards the 
	label. </li>
<li>
<font face="Arial"> For PDB files and for MOPAC files with PDB information, t</font>he 
	same labels must be present in both the reference and job data sets.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>It is normal for this test to fail the first time it is run.&nbsp; Use the 
error message to identify the fault, then correct the fault and re-run the job.&nbsp; 
When no errors are reported, the data set labels are acceptable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The following flexibilities are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the only operation is comparing two geometries, then the species can 
	have different empirical formulae. Also, some atoms can have different 
	labels, but all such atoms will be excluded from the comparison.</li>
<li>The order of atoms does not need to be the same.&nbsp; If the order is 
	different, the reference data set will be re-ordered to match the job data 
	set.</li>
<li>Where there is ambiguity, e.g., C<font face="Arial"><span class="b"><sub>&delta;1</sub> 
	and C<sub>&delta;2</sub></span></font> in Phe and Tyr. Ambiguities of this 
	type are automatically resolved by re-labeling atoms in the reference data 
	set, unless <font face="Arial"> <a href="noswap.html"><tt>NOSWAP</tt></a> is 
	present.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>From a practical point of view, this flexibility means that the order of 
atoms in the two data sets is not important.</p>
<p>The reference data set will then be rotated and translated to give the best 
overlap with the job data set.&nbsp; This new geometry will be printed as 
&lt;filename&gt;.new&nbsp; Total geometric differences between the two structures 
will be printed in the output.</p>
<h3>Comparing geometries</h3>
<p>If the keywords <tt>GEO_REF</tt>,
<font face="Arial"> <a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a>
</font>
and <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> are all present, or if
<a href="compare.html"><tt>COMPARE</tt></a> is present, then an HTML web-page 
will be written that allows pairs of structures to be compared. </p>
<p>If there are some atoms in one data-set that are not in the other, or vice 
versa, then the job will be stopped.&nbsp; However, if <a href="geo-ok.html">
<tt>GEO-OK</tt></a> is present then the job will continue, but using only the atoms that are 
common to both data-sets.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Improving X-ray geometries</h3>
<p>The accuracy of native structures, X-ray and NMR, can be increased by 
performing a limited geometry optimization, starting with the conditioned native 
structure.</p>
<p>The optimized geometry is a hybrid of the PM7 geometry, assuming that PM7 is 
used, and the native geometry.&nbsp; The hybrid heat of formation, <i>H</i>', is 
given as:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;H' =&Delta;<i>H<sub>f</sub>(</i>PM7) + <i>c</i><span class="b">&Sigma;</span>(X<sub>i</sub> 
- X<sub>i</sub>(0))<sup>2</sup>
</p><p align="left">That is, at each geometry, a restraining potential is added 
to the PM7 heat of formation.&nbsp;
<font face="Arial"> To specify a restraint, put the new value after the 
reference data set, e.g., if a value of 10 is wanted, use:



<tt>GEO_REF="M:\data_sets\CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop"10</tt>
or
<tt>GEO_REF="CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop"10.&nbsp;</tt></font></p>
<p>The effect of the restraining potential is to reduce PM7 errors in the 
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.&nbsp; It has very little effect 
on the primary structure, e.g., bond lengths and angles.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>The effect of the restraining potential can be illustrated using Crambin, 
1CBN.&nbsp; In the original structure there was an extra C<sub>2</sub>O moiety, this was 
removed.&nbsp; 1CBN has both structural and positional disorder; the sequence 
used was: <br/>
TTCCPSIVARSNFNVCRLPGT<b>P</b>EALCATYTGCIIIPGATCPGDYAN&nbsp; This sequence 
differs from the later default sequence of TTCCPSIVARSNFNVCRLPGT<b>S</b>EALCATYTGCIIIPGATCPGDYAN 
(difference in <b>bold</b>)&nbsp; The formula used was C<sub>202</sub>H<sub>315</sub>N<sub>55</sub>O<sub>64</sub>S<sub>6</sub>, 
i.e. 642 atoms.&nbsp; Because the positions of the hydrogen atoms were severely 
incorrect in the X-ray structure, before starting any comparison of the effect 
of <tt>GEO_REF</tt> on the geometry, their positions were optimized.&nbsp; 
During geometry optimization, the COSMO solvation model was used because some 
residues in Crambin were reported as being ionized.<img align="right" border="0" height="306" src="geo_re2.gif" width="413"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<img align="left" border="0" height="307" src="geo_re1.gif" width="426"/>The difference in heat of formation of 
Crambin, after 
preconditioning (that is, after the positions of the hydrogen atoms were 
optimized), and after 
complete geometry optimization, is ~250 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The RMS change in 
geometry is about 1.0 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; If the 
geometry is optimized using <tt>GEO_REF</tt> and a constant, <i>c</i>, of 1.0, then the heat of formation drops by
~150 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and the RMS geometry change is ~0.25 
&Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; In other words, by allowing the X-ray geometry to change by 0.25 
&Aring;ngstroms, over half of the strain energy in the X-ray structure is removed.&nbsp; 
Put yet another way, the resulting geometry is more than twice as accurate, in terms of 
chemistry, than the X-ray structure.&nbsp; <a href="Crambin_Aq_geo_ref.zip">All 
Crambin structures used here</a>.


</p><h3>Locating transition states</h3>
<p><tt>GEO_REF</tt> can also be used for moving a reactant or product geometry in the 
direction of the transition state.&nbsp; Consider two data sets, reactant.mop 
and product.mop in folder M:\, in which the heat of formation of the optimized 
product geometry is lower than that of the optimized reactant geometry.&nbsp; 
The product geometry geometry can be moved in the direction of the transition 
state by using keyword


<tt>GEO_REF="M:\reactant.mop"</tt>&nbsp; 
The .arc file can then be edited to give a new data set, product_on_slope.mop.&nbsp; 
The reactant geometry can then be moved in the direction of this new geometry by 
using keyword


<tt>GEO_REF="M:\product_on_slope.mop"</tt>&nbsp; 
Again, edit the .arc file to give reactant_on_slope.mop.&nbsp; Why was the 
product moved first?&nbsp; Because by moving it towards the reactant geometry, 
its heat of formation would rise in proportion to the distance to the reactant 
geometry. When the reactant geometry is moved towards the product geometry on 
the slope, the distance from the starting reactant geometry to the product 
geometry on the slope is less, so the rise in energy would be less.

</p><p>If keyword TS is present in a GEO_REF calculation, the optimization is not 
run.&nbsp; Instead, the two geometries are averaged, and the result written to a 
new file &lt;file&gt;.new.</p>
<p>For the current exercise, a good approximation to the transition state can 
then be generated from the data set reactant_on_slope.mop by using keywords TS 
and

 <tt>GEO_REF="M:\product_on_slope.mop"</tt>
</p><h3><a name="Error">Error</a>: "Fault detected in atom labels in a GEO_REF run"</h3>
<p>If the only faults detected are those that involve hydrogen atoms, then add 
keyword <a href="geo-ok.html"><tt>GEO-OK</tt></a>, and do not have<font face="Arial"> <a href="noswap.html"><tt>NOSWAP</tt></a>,
</font>and re-run. The hydrogen atoms will be put in their correct place 
automatically. Alternatively, edit either 
the data-set or the <tt>GEO_REF</tt> file to remove the fault.</p><p>
