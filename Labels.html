<h2>Description of Atom Labels</h2>
<p>The most simple definition of an atom is to use either its chemical symbol or 
its atomic number, thus:</p>
<p>Mg 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1&nbsp; or<br/>
12&nbsp; 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1</p>
<p>If <a href="Isotope_specification.html">isotopes</a> are used, then the 
atomic number option cannot be used.</p>
<p>In addition to the symbol or atomic number, a label can be added to an atom.&nbsp; 
The format of the label is: "(<i>text</i>)" (without the quotation marks), that 
is, "open curved bracket, <i>text</i>, closed curved bracket" The 
label should be immediately after the chemical symbol or after the isotopic 
mass, if present.</p>
<p><i>text</i> can be up to 38 characters long, but much shorter descriptions 
should normally be used, otherwise the layout of the output becomes very messy.&nbsp; 
If&nbsp; <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> is used, avoid any of the 
symbols &quot;0&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, and &quot;-&quot; unless an atom must have a charge, see below, instead 
use <tt><a href="setpi.html">SETPI</a></tt> to explicitly assign &#960; bonds, and <a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> to explicitly make or 
break bonds. </p>
<p>Examples of atom labels:</p>
<p>Mg(At center of porphyrin ring) 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1 <br/>
&nbsp;C( 17 PHE* 2) 1.19 1 4.59 1 -0.18 1<br/>
&nbsp;C14.0( 17 PHE* 2) 1.19 1 4.59 1 -0.18 1</p>
<p>A special type of atom label is used in protein work.&nbsp; These labels are 
exactly 26 characters long, and correspond to the first 26 characters of a PDB 
file.&nbsp; Labels for atoms in proteins can be generated in two ways:<br/>
(A) When a PDB file is read in, the resulting MOPAC data set has the atoms 
labeled automatically.&nbsp; See also <a href="atom_numbers.html">atom numbering</a>.&nbsp; <br/>
(B) When a MOPAC data set is read in, and there is enough information in the 
atom labels to allow the PDB atom labels to be written.</p>
<p>If <a href="residues.html"><tt>RESIDUES</tt></a> is present, the resulting ARC file 
will include labels on each atom. If <tt>RESIDUES</tt> is used, all existing 
labels, including labels defining individual charges, will be replaced.</p>
<h3>Atom Charges</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Charges on individual atoms for use in MOZYME can be specified by the 
symbols "+" or "-" as the first character of the atom labels. When the symbol "+" 
is present, the atom is given a unit positive charge, and when "-" is present, the 
atom is given a unit negative charge.&nbsp; However, this feature can only adjust
charge states to resolve the assignment of pi bonds and lone pairs, as demonstrated by a set of
<a href="mozyme_example_charges.html">representative examples</a>. Avoid using charge labels
unless necessary, as the same effect can usually be produced with keywords.&nbsp;
For example, if the ethyl group, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>,
is run with <a href="charge.html"><tt>CHARGE=1</tt></a>, then the CH<sub>2</sub> carbon will 
automatically be given a positive charge, if <tt>CHARGE=-1</tt> is present, the it will 
be given a negative charge.</p>
