<h1 align="center" dir="ltr">Examples of calculations involving Proteins</h1>
<h2 align="left"><u>Preparing a raw data dataset</u></h2>
<p align="left">One of the best resources for starting protein structures is the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a>. The PDB 
contains structures for a huge number of proteins, and is being continuously 
updated.&nbsp; Not all structures are of high accuracy, for example older X-ray 
structures often have unrealistic interatomic distances, however in such cases 
the tertiary structures are still good enough for all routine work.&nbsp; NMR 
structures should be avoided - whenever NMR geometries are optimized, the RMS 
difference between the optimized and NMR structure is much larger than the X-ray 
equivalent.</p>
<h3 align="left">Choice of PDB structure</h3>
<p align="left">Before starting work on proteins, careful thought should be 
given to deciding what it is that is to be done.&nbsp; If the objective is to 
compare the predicted structure with the X-ray structure, then almost any X-ray 
structure would do.&nbsp; If the objective is to model a reaction or a docked 
substrate, then a lot of human effort can be saved by selecting a structure that 
includes an inhibitor.&nbsp; First of all, the inhibitor shows where the 
substrate should be and its approximate orientation.&nbsp; When the geometry is 
optimized, the inhibitor can then be converted into the desired substrate, and 
the geometry re-optimized to give either the reactants, transition state, or 
products. </p>
<p align="left">If there are several entries in the PDB that meet the desired 
criteria, then select the one that is most complete. Download the PDB source 
file, and edit it to make a MOPAC data set. MOPAC data sets can use internal or 
Cartesian coordinates, or a mixture of the two types.&nbsp; In protein 
work, use Cartesian coordinates for all atoms except when a reaction path is 
involved, in which case a single atom (the moving atom) would normally be in 
internal coordinates.&nbsp; </p>
<h3 align="left">Preconditioning</h3>
<p align="left">Most PDB entries lack hydrogen atoms, and many have positional 
or structural disorder.&nbsp; Fortunately, when the focus of the work is to 
model the active site, structural disorder is almost always unimportant - the 
difference between a Leu and an Ile far from the active site never affects the mechanism.&nbsp; Likewise, 
positional disorder is also unimportant.&nbsp; For positional disorder to exist, 
the energies of the two conformers must be similar, so obviously either one can 
be chosen.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Use a third-party program to add hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Ideally, 
that program would add hydrogen atoms correctly, but every program thus far examined has 
limitations.&nbsp; Most programs look at a residue, and decide whether to ionize 
it without consideration of the environment.&nbsp; So if the sequence -Glu-Glu-Glu- 
were to occur, all three residues would be ionized; this can result in 
unrealistic charges.&nbsp; To see why, consider a dicarboxylic acid, e.g., 
succinic acid. The first pKa might be low, but the second is inevitably high, 
indicative of the fact that the di-ion is unstable.&nbsp; A useful strategy to 
avoid unrealistic states of ionization is to first neutralize all charges.&nbsp; 
This is not as drastic as it sounds - during the geometry optimization, protons 
can migrate from acid to base residues to form salt bridges.&nbsp; If a specific 
proton does not migrate, the data set can be edited so that the proton is moved. 
After re-optimizing the geometry, the decision can be made regarding the 
preferred state based on the total heat of formation.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Once the hydrogen atoms have been added, run a calculation 
using the  keywords&nbsp; <tt> <a href="charges.html">CHARGES</a></tt> and <tt>
<a href="residues.html">RESIDUES</a></tt>.&nbsp; In the output, check for the 
message "Residues where the number of hydrogen atoms is not equal to that 
expected."&nbsp; If the message exists, carefully examine the residues indicated.&nbsp; 
If any residues are ionized, edit the data set to remove the ionization.&nbsp; 
Any residues that are not recognized are the result of either a mistake, in which case 
correct it, or are a hetero group - a non-standard residue.&nbsp; If that 
is the case, use <a href="xeno.html"><tt>XENO</tt></a> to allow it to be recognized.&nbsp; 
It is not necessary that all residues be&nbsp; recognized in order for the calculation to run, 
but when they are all properly identified, the probability of errors in the data 
set is reduced.&nbsp; Also check any hetero groups, such as heme or retinal, to 
verify that the hydrogenation is correct.</p>
<h3 align="left">Preliminary geometry optimization - Hydrogen atoms only</h3>
<p align="left">Before optimizing the entire structure, a useful operation is to 
optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; This is done using
<a href="nooptx.html"><tt>NOOPT</tt></a> and <a href="optx.html"><tt>OPT-H</tt></a>.&nbsp; Once the geometry is optimized, check the 
ionization states.&nbsp; The "salt rules" should be obeyed: for every ionized 
residue, there should be a counterion near to it.&nbsp; Less strict, but still 
important, every possible hydrogen bond should exist. The one exception to the 
salt rules is that all Arg should be ionized.&nbsp; If any Arg are not ionized, 
ionize them "by hand" and if there are potential counterions nearby, ionize them 
to balance the charge.&nbsp; If there are no counterions, put a net charge on 
the system. When you're satisfied that the geometry is good, save a copy of the 
data set.&nbsp; This represents a clean starting point based on the PDB 
structure. In the following discussion, we'll refer to this structure as PDB.mop</p>
<p align="left">Another useful operation to do at this point is to re-sequence 
the atoms into the standard PDB format.&nbsp; This is done with keyword
<a href="reseq.html"><tt>RESEQ</tt></a>.&nbsp; After re-sequencing all atoms, 
particularly the hydrogen atoms, in the same residue are together.&nbsp; </p>
<h2 align="left"><u>Global optimization</u></h2>
<p align="left">First, if you haven't already done so, save a copy of the 
structure from the previous step.&nbsp; Things will go wrong naturally, so 
you'll want a fall-back position to re-start from when disaster occurs.&nbsp; 
For even average sized proteins, global optimization can take CPU days, so 
anything that can increase the efficiency of this process is worthwhile.&nbsp; 
The following sequence has been found to be efficient:</p>
<p align="left">(A) Using keywords <tt>GNORM=10 OPT</tt>, perform a rough 
geometry optimization.&nbsp; During this process, the energy will drop rapidly 
at the start, then the rate of decrease will taper off. Edit the resulting .arc 
file to make a new data set.<br/>
(B) Using keywords <tt>GNORM=5</tt>, perform a more precise 
optimization.&nbsp; The energy will continue to drop, but not as fast as in the 
previous step.&nbsp; Again edit the resulting .arc file to make a new data set.<br/>
(C) Run the new data set with <tt>1SCF</tt>, and carefully examine the 
output and .arc file to make sure that everything is correct.&nbsp; Pay 
particular attention to the active site and to important hetero groups such as 
HEME.</p>
<h2 align="left" dir="ltr"><u><font face="Times New Roman">Location of 
Transition States</font></u></h2>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Location of transition states is a complicated process 
due to the great size of the systems involved.&nbsp; As with global 
optimization, great care must be exercised in ensuring that the calculations are 
going correctly.&nbsp; Many steps are involved, and as a result, the whole 
process requires a lot of human as well as CPU time.&nbsp; Therefore, before 
starting on a project to locate a transition state, carefully consider: it the 
result worth the effort.&nbsp; Do not start unless you are willing to expend a 
lot of effort, and be aware that success is not always achieved.&nbsp; Having 
said this, if you are still committed to locating transition states in chemical 
reactions, the main steps are as follows:</p>
<ul>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><a href="#IRC">Generate the full reaction path using the <tt>IRC</tt>.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">These techniques are used in a
<a href="mopac_examples/MOZYME_Examples/Chymotrypsin.zip">complete worked 
example</a> of the location of a transition state in chymotrypsin catalyzed 
hydrolysis of a peptide bond.</p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr"><a name="Prepare_data_set">Prepare a data set that represents the reactants and 
products</a></h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Before any work is started on modeling 
enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the reaction to be investigated should be written 
out in the normal diagrammatic form.&nbsp; For example, during the aspartate 
protease catalyzed hydrolysis of a peptide bond, two or three distinct steps are 
involved, with the net result that a water molecule adds across the peptide bond 
to give rise to a carboxylic acid and an amine.&nbsp; This is, of necessity, a 
complicated process, so for convenience the mechanism is best expressed as the 
sum of a few distinct steps.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">A good starting point is the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a>.&nbsp; 
Positioning the reactants and products is difficult, fortunately there is a 
simple procedure that can be used to make both reactants and products.&nbsp; 
Enzymes can be rendered inactive by the addition of an inhibitor.&nbsp; This is 
normally a small molecule that has the approximate shape of a transition-state 
geometry, but is in fact a ground-state system.&nbsp; Many inhibitors are 
phosphorus V compounds, which mimic the enhanced valence of carbon in a 
transition state, for example <span hasbox="2">
IVA-VAL-VAL-LEU(P)-(O)PHE-ALA-ALA-OME in PDB entry 1QRP.&nbsp; 1QRP is an 
aspartate protease inactivated by a synthetic phosphate inhibitor.&nbsp; At 
first sight, this system might not appear to be a suitable model for a protease 
reaction, but by replacing the phosphate group with a peptide linkage and a 
water molecule, the system becomes more like the reactant ground state of a 
hydrolysis reaction.&nbsp; During the early stages of modeling hydrolysis, the 
nature of the groups attached to the peptide linkage are not critical, so these 
can be replaced with a small, innocuous, group such as methyl.&nbsp; The 
substrate is thus converted from&nbsp; IVA-VAL-VAL-LEU(P)-(O)PHE-ALA-ALA-OME to 
N-methyl acetamide plus water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the geometry of this system 
is optimized, the result is the reactant geometry.&nbsp; By adding the water 
molecule to the peptide bond, the tetrahedral intermediate can be made, and 
geometry optimization of this structure gives rise to the product geometry.</span></p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr"><a name="examin_data_sets">Examine the data sets</a> to ensure that they are what you 
want.</h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">A useful calculation to run at this point is to use 
the two keywords:
<a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> <a href="pdbout.html">PDBOUT</a>.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Look at the 
output, and check that all residues are correctly identified.&nbsp; Any that are 
not identified will be indicated by an error message.&nbsp; If any such messages 
are found, and the residue is not one of the standard residues, then use keyword
<a href="xeno.html"><tt>XENO</tt></a> to re-define the residue. If the residue 
is incorrect, correct the fault and re-run.&nbsp; Although using <tt>XENO</tt> 
is not essential, it does reduce the possibility of having an incorrect 
structure by focusing attention on non-standard residues. </p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Check the sequence against the original PDB file.&nbsp; 
If a residue is different, find out why it is different.&nbsp; If the residue 
numbers are different, use keyword <tt><font color="#0000ff">
<a href="start_res.html"><u>START_RES(<i>text</i>)</u></a></font></tt> to change 
the residue numbering to suit the PDB file.&nbsp; If a chain name is incorrect, 
use <tt><font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="chains.html">CHAINS(<i>text</i></a>)</u></font></tt>&nbsp; 
to re-name the chains to match the PDB file.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Look for any messages of the type "Residues where the 
number of hydrogen atoms is not equal to that expected," if any are found, 
carefully check the residue.&nbsp; If any non-standard groups, such as heme, are 
present, check these using a GUI, as the checks in MOPAC do not work with such 
groups. </p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Look at the block headed "<span lang="EN">Number of 
charged sites identified."&nbsp; Versify that the ionized sites are those 
expected. A useful, but not essential check is to ensure that the "salt rules" 
are obeyed - every ionized site should have a counterion within a few
<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">
Another file created during this run is the Protein Data Bank file &lt;name&gt;.pdb.&nbsp; 
Open this file using a GUI. and compare the structure with that downloaded from 
the PDB.&nbsp; If all the hydrogen atoms are at the end of the Z-matrix, they 
can be put in their correct position using </font></span><tt>
<font color="#0000ff"><a href="reseq.html"><u>
RESEQ</u></a></font></tt>.&nbsp; Look at the active site, and check that the 
environment is that expected.&nbsp; Pay careful attention to hydrogen bonds in 
the active site - if one is wrongly positioned, then when the reaction occurs 
the energy might suddenly drop by several kcal/mol.&nbsp; This can be very 
disconcerting!</p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr">Using the<a href="geo_ref.html" name="use_geo_ref"> <tt>GEO_REF</tt> </a> option, 
move the reactant geometry in the direction of the product geometry, and <i>vice 
versa.&nbsp; </i></h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Three special points on the potential energy surface 
are needed for a normal reaction: the reactant geometry, the product geometry 
and the transition state geometry.&nbsp; These are, in order of increasing 
energy: product &lt; reactant &lt; transition state.&nbsp; If these conditions exist, 
then moving the product geometry towards the reactant geometry will also move it 
towards the transition state.&nbsp; Likewise moving the reactant geometry 
towards to product geometry will move it towards the transition state.&nbsp; 
This process has to be iterative - in the first step, both reactant and product 
are moved on to the slope of the reaction barrier, then they are moved up the 
slope, then further up the slope.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Before starting, make sure that there is a one-to-one 
correspondence of all atoms in the reactant structure with those in the product 
structure.&nbsp; If any hetero groups are going to be involved in the reaction, 
they must be present.&nbsp; Small differences in the atom sequence are 
acceptable.&nbsp; For example, the PDB convention does not define which carbon 
in Phe is <span class="b">&Delta;</span><sub>1</sub> and which is
<span class="b">&Delta;</span><sub>2</sub>, to allow for this necessary ambiguity 
the order of occurrence of atoms can be changed at run-time, provided the 
changes are small.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Before proceeding, read the notes on biasing a 
geometry towards another structure in
<a href="Applying_geometry_constraints.html#bias_to_barrier">geometry constraints</a>. 
Assume that the reactant data set's name is reactant.mop, and the product data 
set name is product.mop</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">The first step in locating the transition state 
involves moving the product (the lower energy structure) towards the reactant.&nbsp; 
Use the default <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a> keyword&nbsp; for 
this. Edit the file product.mop to add the keyword <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/reactant.mop"</tt> 
and run that calculation.<br/>
Next, move the reactant towards the product.&nbsp; Edit reactant.mop to add the 
keyword <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/product.arc"</tt>, and run that job.&nbsp; Note that 
MOPAC data sets can be either normal .mop files or MOPAC archive files.<br/>
Edit the files reactant.arc and product.arc to make new data sets.&nbsp; Call 
these reactant_3.mop and product_3.mop.&nbsp; <br/>
Almost certainly, product_3.mop will have the lower energy - check the 
newly-created ARC files.&nbsp; Edit it to add the keyword <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/reactant_3.mop"10</tt>, 
and run that file.&nbsp; Edit the file reactant_3.mop to add the keyword <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/product_3.arc"10</tt>,&nbsp; 
and run that.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Edit the resulting ARC files to make new datasets, to 
be called reactant_10.mop and product_10.mop. Whichever one has the lower 
energy, use that first in the next step.&nbsp; If it's product_10.mop, then use 
keyword&nbsp; <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/reactant_10.mop"20</tt>, 
if it's reactant_10.mop, then use&nbsp; <tt>GEO_REF="&lt;path-name&gt;/product_10.mop"20.&nbsp;</tt> 
When that calculation is done, use the resulting ARC file in the next 
calculation..</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">At each stage, look at the output and check that the 
"distance" between the reactant and product geometries is decreasing.&nbsp; That 
is, that the structures are simultaneously moving towards the transition state.</p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr"><a name="average">When the distance</a> between the 
reactant and product geometries is small enough, the two geometries are averaged.</h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"> <tt>GEO_REF </tt>should not be used to locate the 
transition state - as the distance from the reactant or product to the 
transition state becomes small, <tt>GEO_REF </tt>becomes too slow.&nbsp; Once 
the distance is small, less than about 10 <font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;,</font> set up 
a normal  <tt>GEO_REF </tt>  calculation, but 
this time add the keyword <tt>TS</tt>.&nbsp; That will average the two geometries and 
give a good approximation to the transition state.</p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="Refine_TS">Optimize the geometry</a> of 
the rest of the system, while ignoring the transition state, and refine the geometry of 
the transition state, while temporarily ignoring the rest of the system.</font></h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">If everything has gone according to plan, the geometry 
from the last step will be a good approximation to the transition state.&nbsp; 
Before proceeding further, check that the structure is indeed what was expected.&nbsp; 
Once satisfied that the structure is correct proceed as follows:</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Using a GUI, identify the atoms involved in the 
reaction.&nbsp; This should be the three or four atoms that are involved in 
bond-making, bond-breaking (call these the central atoms), plus all the atoms 
they are bonded to, plus all the atoms bonded to the atoms bonded to the central 
atoms.&nbsp; This should amount to between 6 and 12 atoms.<br/>
Edit the data-set to set the optimization flags for these atoms to "0", that is, 
mark them as "not to be optimized."</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Refining the transition state can be done in a single, 
long, calculation that involves repeated pairs of calculations.&nbsp; The first 
of each pair consists of an energy minimization while freezing the transition 
state.&nbsp; The second of each pair consists of gradient minimization of the 
transition state, while freezing all atoms not involved in the transition state.&nbsp; 
As this is an unusually complicated calculation, it is helpful to see the form 
of the data set:</p><pre>MOZYME

<p align="left" dir="ltr">To explain: The first set of keywords defines a 
geometry optimization.&nbsp; Because the active site is frozen, the optimization 
affects all the rest of the system.&nbsp; The next set of keywords, "<tt>MOZYME  INVERT TS OLDGEO</tt>"
