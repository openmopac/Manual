Hydrogenation of biologic macromolecules using MOPAC</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">
Two conditions are necessary for protein modeling: a computational chemistry 
technique, and a realistic model. Most models are constructed from PDB files, 
which normally do not include hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Several methods are 
available for adding hydrogen atoms, of which readily available methods are
<a href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/">MolProbity</a>,
<a href="http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/graphics/whatif/html/index.html">
WHAT IF</a>,
<a href="http://scbx.mssm.edu/mezeilab/molmod/gold_docs/gold.1.11.html">GOLD</a>,
and
<a href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/HAAD/">HAAD Online</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
So why have another hydrogenation routine?&nbsp; For computational chemistry 
modeling work, a realistic model must comply with very strict rules, for 
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="auto-style1">The model must be for the system of interest.&nbsp; 
	Such systems might include metal ions and heterogroups such as heme and 
	porphyrin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="auto-style1">Hydrogenation must be correct.&nbsp; Even one atom 
	incorrectly hydrogenated could invalidate the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="auto-style1">Selective protonation to form salt bridges, isolated 
	ionized sites, etc., must be allowed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">In MOPAC, hydrogenation is done in two steps.&nbsp; In 
the first step, using keyword <a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt>,</a> hydrogen atoms are 
added to neutralize as much of the system as possible.&nbsp; Moieties that 
always exist as ions, for example sodium and calcium, are not hydrogenated.&nbsp; 
This produces a well-defined starting point for the second step.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">In the second step, keyword <a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a> 
is used to form ionized sites.&nbsp; These are the salt bridges and individual 
ionized residues and other species. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">To minimize errors, both steps are normally done in one 
job by having <tt>ADD-H</tt>, and one or more <tt>SITE</tt> keywords. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">When hydrogen atoms are added to a system, they are not 
well positioned.&nbsp; Before proceeding, therefore, a geometry optimization of 
the hydrogen atoms needs to be performed.&nbsp; A recommended procedure for this 
operation would be to include the <a href="charge.html"><tt>CHARGE</tt></a> keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
the net charge on the system is known, then that should be used.&nbsp; Thus 
simple proteins, hydrogenated using <tt>ADD-H SITE=(SALT)</tt>, should have a 
charge of zero. If the calculated charge is different to that expected, examine 
the output to locate the cause of the difference.&nbsp; Assigning the net charge 
can be extremely tedious when large proteins are used.&nbsp; To simplify this 
operation, a list of all charged sites is printed whenever an SCF calculation is 
requested. When <tt>SITE</tt> is used, a list of the changes in charged sites is 
printed, together with the net change in charge.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1">Non-zero net charges can exist when metal atoms, such as 
Na and Ca, are present, also when complicated neutral heterogroups, such as 
heme, are covalently bound to proteins.&nbsp; This most commonly occurs when Fe 
of heme forms a bond with the sulfur atom of a cysteine residue.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">MOZYME will not allow a system to be run where the net 
charge defined by a keyword is different to that calculated by MOZYME.&nbsp; If 
MOZYME does make a mistake, typically by picking the wrong resonance structure, the 
fault can be corrected by keywords such as <a href="setpi.html"><tt>SETPI</tt></a> or, 
less commonly, by <a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a>.</p>
