<h3 class="auto-style2">General</h3>
<p><span class="auto-style2">The final result of a </span> <a href="Locate-TS.html"><tt>LOCATE-TS</tt></a>
<span class="auto-style2">calculation 
should be a transition state.&nbsp; Sometimes the result is a stable 
intermediate, i.e., a ground state and not a transition state structure.&nbsp; To 
check whether the final geometry is in fact a transition state for the reaction 
being studied, two steps are necessary.&nbsp; In the first step, the vibrational 
frequencies of the atoms in the region of the reaction site are calculated.&nbsp; 
If one of these frequencies is large and imaginary (printed as a negative 
number), and all the rest are positive or small and imaginary, then the system 
is confirmed to be a transition state.&nbsp; In the second step, the geometry is 
displaced by a small amount in the direction of the imaginary vibrational normal 
mode, and the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate, using</span> <a href="irc.html"><tt>IRC</tt></a><span class="auto-style2">, is generated.&nbsp; This is repeated 
after reversing the displacement.&nbsp; The two IRC curves are then joined 
together.&nbsp; If the ends of the resulting curve corresponds to the reactant 
and product, then the imaginary mode is confirmed to be correct.</span></p>
<h3 class="auto-style2">Verifying that the system is a transition state</h3>
<p><span class="auto-style2">The starting point for validating a transition state is the final ARC file 
from a&nbsp; </span> <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt><span class="auto-style2"> run.&nbsp; Edit this file to remove everything except the data 
set, i.e. everything except the keyword, title, and comment line, and the 
geometry.&nbsp; Edit the keywords to replace the</span> <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt>
<span class="auto-style2">keyword with</span>
<a href="force.html"><tt>FORCETS</tt></a> <a href="isotope.html"><tt>ISOTOPE</tt></a>
<a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> <a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a><span class="auto-style2">. &nbsp;Having</span><tt> ISOTOPE</tt><span class="auto-style2"> 
is very useful here because it allows a restart to be done in a later calculation, 
either for for modeling a Kinetic Isotope Effect or to start an </span> <a href="irc.html"><tt>IRC</tt></a><span class="auto-style2"> 
calculation. Save the file as a MOPAC data set using a suitable name, e.g., 
Step_1_2_FORCE.mop, then run it using MOPAC.</span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style2">Only atoms with optimization flags set to "+1" or "1" will be included in the</span> <tt>FORCETS</tt>
<span class="auto-style2">calculation.&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p><span class="auto-style2">When</span> <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt>&nbsp; 
<span class="auto-style2">is used, the option exists to select only the 
atoms involved in bond making and breaking (Set:1) or these atoms plus those 
attached to them (Set:2).&nbsp; The ARC file from a </span> <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt>
<span class="auto-style2">run can easily be edited to 
convert from Set:1 to Set:2 or vice versa.&nbsp; To go from Set:1 to Set:2, look 
in the</span> <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> <span class="auto-style2">output file for the two sets. Set:2 includes Set:1, so 
identify the new atoms in Set:2 that are not in Set:1.&nbsp; Edit the </span> <tt>FORCETS 
</tt>
<span class="auto-style2">data set to change the optimization flags of these new atoms from "+0" to "+1" 
then save the resulting data set with a new name, e.g., Step_1_2_FORCE_Set2.mop.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">After running the data set, examine the output to verify that there is 
exactly one negative vibrational frequency. (Genuine transition states have 
exactly one imaginary vibrational frequency, but for convenience in 
computational chemistry programs, this is normally displaced as a frequency 
preceded by a minus sign, so such vibrational frequencies are often called 
negative vibrations.&nbsp; This convention will be used here.) If there are no 
negative frequencies, the system is a ground state, possibly a stable 
intermediate.&nbsp; If there is more than one negative frequency more negative 
than ~-100cm^(-1), then something is wrong.</p>

Coordinate</a></span>.</p>
