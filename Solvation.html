<h1>Solvation</h1>
<p>A realistic model of a protein is essential for studying biochemical 
processes.&nbsp; If solvation is not used, then electrostatic effects, in 
particular those arising from ionized sites, on the surface of proteins would 
not be handled properly.&nbsp; Adding implicit solvation by use of
<a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a> makes the computational model more realistic.&nbsp; 
A realistic model is necessary because energy changes in biochemical processes 
are often very small - in the order of zero to a few Kcal/mol - and phenomena 
that depend on such small changes might not be reproduced properly if solvation 
was not used.</p>
<p>The cost, in terms of compute requirements, is not great, and the quality of 
the model is improved significantly.&nbsp; Therefore, for all work involving 
proteins, use implicit solvation.</p>
<p>In the region of an active site, individual water molecules are important.&nbsp; 
For this reason, explicit water molecules should be used, in addition to the use 
of implicit solvation.</p>
