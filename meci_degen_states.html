<h2>Degenerate States
</h2>
By the Jahn-Teller theorem, systems with orbital degeneracy will distort so as
to remove the degeneracy.  However, many dynamic Jahn-Teller systems are known
in which the time-average geometry is of the higher point-group.  These systems
are the kind that will be addressed here. <a name="BM13957">&nbsp;</a>
<p>
The analytical RHF configuration interaction first derivative calculation
developed by Liotard&nbsp;[<a href="references.html#analci">43</a>] has been modified to allow systems with
degenerate states to be run.
</p><p>
Each of the degenerate states is a linear combination of microstates. Each
microstate can be described by a Slater
determinant&nbsp;[<a href="references.html#slater_det1">66</a>,<a href="references.html#slater_det2">67</a>], which represents a specific pattern
of occupancy of molecular orbitals. Each M.O. is a linear combination of
Slater atomic orbitals.
</p><p>
The whole state is best described by an equal
mixture of the degenerate states of which it is composed.  Note that this is
NOT a combination of states, rather it is a mixture.  An example of a
combination of  states is a state function, composed of a linear combination of
microstates.  In such a combination the phase-factor between microstates is
significant, thus state(1)=
(1/                            2)<sup>1/2</sup>(Microstate(a) + Microstate(b)) is
different from state(2)
(1/                            2)<sup>1/2</sup>(Microstate(a) - Microstate(b)).  An
example of a mixture of states is the <sup>2</sup>T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub> state of TiF<sub>6</sub><sup>3-</sup>, a
<i>d</i><sup>1</sup> system, in which the best description of the state is an equal mixture of
the three degenerate space components of T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>, and an equal mixture of the
two spin components of the Kramer's doublet.  The overall state is thus
1/6(<img align="MIDDLE" alt="$\alpha$" border="0" height="29" src="img992.gif" width="16"/>(T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(x)+T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(y)+T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(z))+
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="$\beta$" border="0" height="31" src="img993.gif" width="15"/>(T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(x)+T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(y)+T<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(z)).
</p><p>
If equimixtures are not used, then the Jahn-Teller theorem applies, and the
system would immediately distort so as to remove the degeneracy.  In the case
of TiF<sub>6</sub><sup>3-</sup>, this would result in distortion from O<sub><i>h</i></sub> to D<sub>4<i>h</i></sub>symmetry.
