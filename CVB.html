<tt>CVB(<i>text</i>)</tt></a></h2>
Sometimes in a <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> calculation, a Lewis structure cannot be constructed from 
the topology of the system supplied.&nbsp;&nbsp; When that happens, a warning message will be printed and 
the run stopped.&nbsp; Unwanted connections can be removed using <tt>CVB</tt>.&nbsp; 
Two formats are supported:<br/><br/><strong>Using atom numbers (if possible, use 
atom labels for proteins)</strong><p><tt>CVB(n1:-n2[;n3:-n4[;n5:-n6....]]])</tt> </p>
<p>where the connections to be removed are those between atoms n1-n2, n3-n4, n5-n6, etc. 
See <a href="atom_numbers.html">atom numbering</a>.&nbsp; Thus if 
connections were to be removed between atoms 4 and 5, and between atoms 665 and 670, then
<tt>CVB(4:-5;665:-670)</tt> would be used.&nbsp; If connections are needed, then don't use the minus sign.&nbsp; Thus if 
connections were 
needed between atoms 4 and 5, and between atoms 665 and 670, then
<tt>CVB(4:5,665:670)</tt> would be used. <tt>CVB</tt> is also useful when 
<a href="residues.html"><tt>RESIDUES</tt></a> and <tt><a href="pdbout.html">PDBOUT</a></tt> 
are present. A topology sometimes has an 
unwanted connection between two chains that prevents some of the residues being 
identified.&nbsp; To correct this fault, remove the unwanted connection using <tt>CVB</tt>. 
&nbsp;If there are a several unwanted connections , and these connections involve a 
specific element, then consider the alternative of using <tt>
<a href="vdw.html">VDWM</a></tt> to change the Van der Waals radius for that 
element.</p>
<p><strong>Using atom labels</strong></p>
<p><tt>CVB("Label1":-"Label2"[;"Label3":-"Label4"[;"Label5":-"Label6"....]]])</tt></p>
<p>Here <tt>Labeln</tt> is the label, in PDB or JSmol format, for the atom.&nbsp; 
Using the PDB format, the label starts 
with the first non-blank character of the atom name and ends with the last 
character of the residue number.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; <tt>CVB("2HB SER B 
4":-"OD1 ASP B 119","1HH1 ARG B 5":"C TYR B 7").</tt>&nbsp; 
Spaces are not important, but using spaces makes it easier to read the atom label.&nbsp; 
With JSmol, the label starts with a "[" and ends at the character before " #".&nbsp; 
As with PDB format, spaces are not important when JSmol format is used, i.e., <tt>CVB("[LYS] 4 : A . CD":"[LYS]4:A.CG")</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of 
using atom labels 
is that if atoms are added or removed the atom label would not change.&nbsp; 
Another advantage is that PDB TER lines, positional disorder, and other things 
that cause the PDB line number to not match the atom number do not cause 
problems.</p>
<p>Wildcards are allowed for the residue name and for the chain letter.&nbsp; 
When a wildcard is used, a letter is replaced by an asterisk, "*", thus:<tt> 
CVB("2HB *** B 4":-"OD1 *** * 119","1HH1 ARG * 5":"C TYR B 7") </tt>and<tt> CVB("[***] 4 : 
* . CD":"[***]4:*.CG")</tt>. The first occurrence that matches 
will be used.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Special case of O-O bonds.</h4>
<p>When proteins that contain a large number of water molecules are edited, 
quite often one or more water molecules become badly positioned, resulting in 
spurious O-O interactions.&nbsp; These can be eliminated using the standard 
options within the CVB keyword, but as this problem occurs quite often, a 
special option, "O:-O" is provided.&nbsp; This six-character option will 
identify and delete all spurious O-O bonds.The option can be anywhere between 
the opening "(" and closing ")" of the CVB keyword.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Intermediates in Enzyme Mechanisms</h4>
<p>
<img height="248" src="S%20and%20Guanindinium.gif" style="float: left" width="271"/>A frequent problem when modeling intermediates and transition states in 
enzyme mechanisms is that the structure cannot be written in Lewis form.&nbsp;An 
example occurs in the transition state when a cystine sulfur starts to bond to 
the carbon of a guanidinium group in an Arg, and the hydrogen that was on the 
sulfur migrates to one of the nitrogen atoms of the guanidinium. If this 
happens, the 
resulting -NH<sub>3</sub> group would have a positive charge and the carbon 
would be given a negative charge.&nbsp; (A carbon atom bonded to a cation and having only three 
valencies used would automatically be assigned a negative charge.) Sulfur having 
only one bond (to its CH<sub>2</sub> group) is, by default, also given a negative charge.&nbsp; 
The net charge on this assembly is now -1 instead of the expected +1.&nbsp; To 
correct this error <tt>CVB </tt> is used to make a bond between S and the H of -NH<sub>3</sub>.&nbsp; 
This automatically causes the N-H bond to be deleted giving -NH<sub>2</sub>, a 
component of the 
normal guanidinium group.&nbsp; Now that sulfur is bonded to its hydrogen as 
will as to its CH<sub>2</sub> group, and 
the guanidinium has the usual +1 charge, the net charge in this region is 
correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
A guiding principle would be to use <tt>CVB </tt> to make the structure as similar to either the 
reactant or product as possible.</p>
<p>
Note that <tt>CVB</tt> is used <em>only</em> in the generation of a starting Lewis
structure or in generating a PDB file. The presence of unrealistic connections in this structure will not
normally give rise to an incorrect SCF.
