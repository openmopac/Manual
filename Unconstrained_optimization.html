<h1>Unconstrained optimization of protein geometries </h1>
<p class="auto-style1">The result of an unconstrained geometry optimization is a stationary point on 
the potential energy surface.&nbsp; This point has several very important 
properties.&nbsp; Among these are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="auto-style1">The geometry refers to a specific system, e.g., the starting point 
	for a reaction step or a salt bridge or a neutral system.&nbsp; </li>
<li><span class="auto-style1">Its heat of formation can be related to heats of formation of similar 
	systems (by "similar" is meant systems with exactly the same formula and 
	charge, and calculated using the same conditions, i.e., </span> <a href="pm7.html">
<tt>PM7</tt></a><span class="auto-style1"> and 
	</span> <a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a><span class="auto-style1">).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">Because of the importance of stationary points, the corresponding ARC files 
should be properly labeled and stored for future use.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">Also, because these structures are so important, unconstrained optimization 
of protein systems should be carried out with unusual care.&nbsp; Use solvation 
for all systems of this type, i.e. use </span> <tt>EPS=78.4</tt><span class="auto-style1">. Optimize the geometry. This might take CPU days 
or even weeks of 
effort, so to be on the safe side, use <a href="t=n.html"><tt>T=4W</tt></a>
<a href="dump.html"><tt>DUMP=2D</tt></a>.&nbsp; If the optimization is not exhaustive subsequent geometric 
operations might compromise any results - changes in heat of formation would be a 
mixture of the original structure still changing and thus its energy decreasing, 
and the energy change caused by the current geometric operation.&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">A useful 
strategy is to optimize the geometry, then if the gradient norm in the ARC file is large, over 
about 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> &Aring;<sup>-1</sup> per atom, simply 
re-optimize the geometry.&nbsp; To do this, either run the ARC file without any 
editing, or edit the ARC file to make a new MOPAC data-set, then run that.</span></p>
