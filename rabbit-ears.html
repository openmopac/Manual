<tt>RABBIT </tt>
</h2>
<p>In a <a href="localize.html"><tt>LOCALIZE</tt></a> calculation, localized 
M.O.'s (LMO's) on an atom that has two or three lone 
pairs are split into one LMO that is mainly sigma and one or two LMO's that are 
mainly pi.&nbsp; When <tt>RABBIT</tt> is present, a <tt>LOCAL</tt> 
calculation will be done, and these LMO's will be replaced with hybrid LMO's that have equal 
amounts of sigma character in each M.O.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;The resulting LMO's are commonly referred to as rabbit-ears because of their 
shape, although they really look more like ear-muffs than rabbit-ears. </p>
<p>All three sets of M.O.'s, canonical, localized, and localized with <tt>RABBIT</tt>, are equivalent, in that the sets are related to each other by unitary 
transforms. Use whichever set best first the current needs.</p>
