This system is designed to allow hydride migration to be modeled.&nbsp; Hydride 
migration reactions occur naturally in some enzyme-catalyzed reactions, such as 
the dehydrogenation of fatty acids to give unsaturated fatty acids.&nbsp; 
Working with entire enzyme systems is very time-consuming, because of their 
size, so instead an exemplar system was used for exploring the chemistry of a 
hydride transfer reaction.
<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style3">In enzyme-catalyzed dehydrogenation, the hydride transfer 
reaction occurs after a proton has been abstracted from the substrate, resulting 
in the formation of an anionic species.&nbsp; In this simulation the substrate 
is represented by prop-2-enal anion.&nbsp; Hydride transfer typically involved 
the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD+, in the simulation 
this is represented by a methylpyridinium cation. Addition of a hydride to NAD+ 
converts it into the reduced form, NADH, represented here by 
4-hydromethylpyridine</p>
&nbsp;<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style3">The components are, on the left-hand side, prop-2-enal 
anion and methylpyridinium cation, and, on the right-hand side neutral 
prop-2enal and 4-hydromethylpyridine.&nbsp; Because of the charges present, the 
simulation is done using the COSMO solvation model.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Before starting any work on the reaction, the geometries 
of both the reactants and the products were fully optimized.&nbsp; In the 
reactants, this positioned the -CH<sub>3</sub> group of the prop-2-enal anion 
near to C<sub>4</sub> of methylpyridinium, and the rest of the prop-2-enal anion 
was oriented across the face of the pyridinium, maximizing the electrostatic 
stabilization resulting from the very large charge separation.&nbsp; That 
electrostatic stabilization is not present in the products, so the two species 
move apart, but only slightly.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">At the transition state, the migrating hydrogen atom is 
positioned approximately mid-way between the carbon atom it came from and the 
carbon atom it is moving towards.</p>
<h2>System analysis</h2>
<h3>Charges</h3>
<p>From the title "hydride migration" the assumption might be made that the 
migrating hydrogen atom would have a large negative atomic charge, however, both 
semiempirical, here PM7, and B3LYP 6-311G predict a small positive charge on the 
migrating atom. The obvious question then arises of how does the negative charge 
move from one species to the other?&nbsp; An examination of the Intrinsic 
Reaction Coordinate (IRC) shows that the net charge on the anion remains almost 
unchanged until the top of the barrier is reached, and that in that 
in the region just

before the transition</a> state,

at the transition state</a>, and just

after the transition state</a>, there is a rapid movement of charge from one species to the other.&nbsp; 
That is, the movement of charge occurs when the migrating hydrogen atom forms a 
bridging bond between the two species. At that point, the PM7 partial charges are, 
on the prop-2-enal: -0.52 (-0.52), on the hydrogen atom +0.13 (+0.22), and on 
the methylpyridine: +0.39 (+0.30). The partial charges in parentheses are those 
predicted by B3LYP 6-311G.</p>

barrier</h3>
<p>The IRC for the reaction is shown in the nearby chart.&nbsp; Each point 
calculated in the IRC is shown as a yellow dot, and a smoothed line through 
these points is also shown in yellow. Only 200 points were generated on each 
side of the transition state, so the starting point on the left-hand side is 
+0.72 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>, versus the optimized &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the reactants 
of -0.97 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; The difference was due to the 
truncation of the IRC.&nbsp; Similarly, on the right-hand side, the chart ends 
at -1.62 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup> versus the optimized &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
of the products of -2.74 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>The "distance" from the start of the left-hand side to the transition state 
is 4.39 &Aring;ngstroms, and from the transition state to the right-hand side is 5.02 
&Aring;ngstroms, for a total chart-width of 9.41 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; Within this space, 
the barrier itself has a width of only about 25% or 
2.35 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; Given that the height of the barrier is about 30 
kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>, this is a very steep barrier.&nbsp; This is reflected in 
the large value of the imaginary frequency for the transition state normal mode, 
of i2472 cm<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; The appearance of the barrier is typical of both 
a proton and a hydrogen atom transfer.&nbsp; </p>
