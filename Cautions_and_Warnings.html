Cautions and Warnings regarding MOPAC</h1>
<p align="left">
MOPAC is a very powerful program, and there is a strong temptation for users to 
assume that it can correctly model all types of system.&nbsp; Simply put: this 
is not correct. In order to get useful results, the input data set must 
represent a chemically sensible system.&nbsp; If this condition is satisfied, 
all will be well: researchers will see their projects succeed, funding agencies 
will get good reports, and everyone will be happy. If this condition is not met, 
then hours, days, even weeks, can be spent trying to make sense of what's going 
on. People new to MOPAC will assume it's faulty and abandon it in disgust, 
research students projects will fail, they'll flunk out of their course, and 
become unemployable, industrial chemists will not produce results, their 
research will falter, they'll not get their annual bonus, in short, they'll 
become unhappy. So in light of all these disastrous possibilities, it is very 
important that certain precautions are taken.</p>
<p align="left">
First, think about what you want to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
<u><b><font size="4">New MOPAC users: </font></b></u>&nbsp;If you're new to 
MOPAC, then spend a few days playing with it before starting any serious work. 
Run small systems, ones that use almost no time.&nbsp; Try things.&nbsp; Find 
what works and what doesn't work.&nbsp; Remember - it is completely impossible 
to hurt MOPAC, and it is very difficult to damage a computer.&nbsp; When MOPAC 
starts to run, it creates its own little virtual world, and if something goes 
wrong, the virtual world disappears.&nbsp; No harm done.&nbsp; If you find 
yourself thinking, "I wonder if this will work?" then <u>TRY IT</u>!&nbsp; 
Experiment. Gain skill and experience. Get a good Graphical User Interface - 
Jmol is excellent, and it's free - and start examining the system. Do not ask 
for help of the type "What would happen if I tried to calculate a hydrogen atom 
that had a charge of +3?" <u>TRY IT YOURSELF</u>.&nbsp; These little experiments 
produce useful information faster than hunting for an expert to ask, and avoids 
wasting the expert's time. If something goes wrong, read the output.&nbsp; There 
will be an error message saying what went wrong, and giving advice on what to do 
next.</p>

<u><b><font size="4">Intermediate MOPAC users</font></b></u><font size="4">:</font> 
Before starting work on a project, spend some time thinking about what you want 
to do.&nbsp; There is an old saying that two weeks in the research lab can save 
you having to spend two hours in the library.&nbsp; The same is true with 
projects. Sketch out the work that needs to be done.&nbsp; Are all the resources 
available?&nbsp; Do I understand the issues involved in the chemistry? Does the 
chemistry I want to model make sense? If the work succeeds, will it tell me 
anything that will advance the project? Once all this is done, and after you've 
decided on a plan of action, a useful tactic is to spend some time trying to 
model parts of the project.&nbsp; There's a good chance that you'll uncover 
previously unsuspected problems. If your system is big, then run simulations on 
much smaller systems first, to get a feel for the issues involved.&nbsp; Again, 
the objective is to avoid wasting your time.&nbsp; CPU time isn't important - 
your time is.</p>
<p align="left">
<b><u><font size="4">Advanced MOPAC users</font></u></b>: Ideally, any mistakes 
made should be caused by MOPAC or the methods inside it, and not by you.&nbsp; 
If the system crashes, please send the faulty data set and output file to
<a href="mailto:openmopac@gmail.com">openmopac@gmail.com</a>, and it'll be 
examined to find the cause of the crash. If you have doubts as to the accuracy 
of the results, compare them with trusted facts.&nbsp; There are three main 
types of "fact".&nbsp; First, experimental results are most reliable.&nbsp; Of course 
this assumes that the experimental work was done correctly, and no errors 
occurred in copying or collating the data.&nbsp; If the experimental results 
were obtained correctly, then these are the nearest to the truth, i.e., nearest 
to the true nature of things.&nbsp; Put another way, the assumption, if not 
definition, of correctness is Nature itself.&nbsp; One caveat is worth noting: 
some phenomena such as dipole and I.P. are not only hard to measure 
experimentally, they sometimes represent something different to what can be 
calculated.&nbsp; The second type of "fact" is a result from a high level 
ab-initio calculation, e.g., a CCSD(T)/CBS calculation. Where high-level and 
semiempirical results differ, high level results should be considered as 
correct, and semiempirical results as being in error. Don't trust the common 
lower-level methods such as HF 6-31G(d) or even B3LYP 6-31G(d).&nbsp; If the 
semiempirical and lower-level results differ, all that can be said is that at 
least one of the methods is faulty - this is not a satisfactory situation. The 
third type of "fact" is the type everyone knows by virtue of the fact that they 
are chemists.&nbsp; This type is quite often misleading.&nbsp; For example, if 
the retinal group: (...C(Me)=CH-CH=CH-C(Me)=CH-CH=N(Me)) is protonated, 
everyone knows that the proton goes on to the nitrogen atom of the Schiff base, 
and "everyone knows" that the nitrogen becomes quaternary, i.e.,&nbsp; (...C(Me)=CH-CH=CH-C(Me)=CH-CH=N(+)H(Me)).&nbsp; 
But if this system is modeled, even using semiempirical methods, the result is 
quite different - the cationic charge is delocalized over the conjugated chain, 
and the nitrogen atom is essentially neutral.&nbsp; As soon as the idea of 
delocalization is suggested, the fallacy of the idea that there is a localized 
cationic charge on the nitrogen atom is obvious.&nbsp; So be careful of 
predigested ideas of the type "everyone knows."</p>

<u><b>Common mistakes made by MOPAC users</b></u></h2>
<p align="left">
<u><b><font size="4">Charged organic systems:</font></b></u> In organic 
chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, solvation is usually essential if a 
charge is involved.&nbsp; Naked charged organic systems do not occur except 
inside a mass spectrometer - a very unusual environment. This is because the 
electric field of the ion has a powerful effect on its surroundings.&nbsp; So 
if, for example, the interaction of a proton with N-Methylacetamide were to be 
examined, the gas-phase system [CH<sub>3</sub>-NH-CO-CH<sub>3</sub> + H(+)]<sup>+</sup> 
would be unrealistic, i.e., not a good model. Using a hydronium or Eigen ion, 
[CH<sub>3</sub>-NH-CO-CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O(+)]<sup>+</sup> or even 
the Zundel ion&nbsp; [CH<sub>3</sub>-NH-CO-CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(+)]<sup>+</sup> 
would not be much better.&nbsp; The best approach would be to use a solvation 
model, and then use the Eigen or Zundel ion.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
Likewise, neutral amino acids never occur in nature, they always exist as the 
Zwitterion, stabilized by the aqueous environment. For these systems, a 
gas-phase calculation would give a completely misleading result.</p>
<p align="left">
<u><b><font size="4">Slab work for surfaces:</font></b></u> Surfaces are usually 
modeled by using a slab of the solid.&nbsp; A typical slab consists of a 
parallelepiped of the solid, cut along with sides of at least 10
<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;ngstroms, and about 7 - 10&Aring; thick. Any Miller 
indices can be used for the surface, with the commonest being {100}, {010}, 
{001}, and {111}.&nbsp; The most frequent mistake made is to not ensure that 
valency requirements are satisfied.&nbsp; Consider a slab of a simple metal 
oxide, MO<sub>2</sub>, M = Ti, Zr, or Hf. The metal atom has a 4+ oxidation 
state, and no "d" electrons.&nbsp; If the slab consisted only of metal and 
oxygen atoms, then the ratio of metal to oxygen would need to be exactly 1:2, 
otherwise if there were an excess of metal atoms, then at least some the metal 
atoms would need to be in the M(3+), i.e., M<sup>iii</sup> state, or lower. As 
this oxidation state has a dramatically different chemistry from the M<sup>iv</sup> 
state,&nbsp; any results obtained would be misleading. If there were an excess 
of oxygen atoms, then some oxygen atoms would need to be part of a peroxide 
system - again, not what was intended. So a ratio of 1:2 is not flexible at 
all.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman">The ratio 1:2 would only be necessary if the slab 
consisted only of metal and oxygen atoms.&nbsp; But a more realistic model could 
be constructed if hydrogen atoms were allowed.&nbsp; In the pure metal-oxygen 
slab, atoms on the surface of the slab might have unwanted valences - an oxygen 
atom might be covalently bonded to only one metal atom, or bonded to three metal 
atoms.&nbsp; Either way, its valency would be strained.&nbsp; By adding hydrogen 
atoms to convert some oxygen atoms into hydroxide, the strain introduced by the 
exposed surface could be reduced.&nbsp; Of course, for every two hydrogen atoms 
added, an extra oxygen atom would also need to be added.&nbsp; Put another way, 
the surface should be hydrated (but not solvated!).</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman"><u><b><font size="4">PDB files:</font></b></u> 
Input data sets must represent realistic chemical systems.&nbsp; Before a 
protein, from the PDB, can be used, it must first be converted into a chemically 
reasonable system.&nbsp; The main changes are to resolve positional and 
structural disorder, if any, and, most important, to add hydrogen atoms. PDB 
files typically do not include hydrogen atoms, and if they are not added, all 
results would be nonsense.&nbsp; Adding hydrogen atoms is not a trivial process: 
most programs get about 99% of the hydrogen atoms added correctly, a few atoms 
might be missed, and some extra atoms might be added. When a protein is first 
run using MOPAC, all errors in the number and positions of hydrogen atoms in 
proteins are printed. <u>READ THE OUTPUT</u> to find which residues are faulty, 
then correct the errors.&nbsp; Unfortunately, non-residues are not checked, so 
hetero groups, particularly porphyrin rings, should be checked very carefully.</font></p>
