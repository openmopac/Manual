<tt>RE-LOCAL </tt>
</h2>
The LMOs used by <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> in the SCF are not fully localized.  At the start they are,
but as the SCF proceeds, they become increasingly delocalized.  At the end of
a calculation, the LMOs may be 5 or 10 percent less than fully localized.
 
To generate localized M.O.s of the type that MOPAC makes, <tt>RE-LOCAL</tt>
should be used.
<p> <tt>RE-LOCAL</tt>
will give results slightly different to those from MOPAC because of two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Sets of LMOs that could be resolved into banana bonds or rabbit ears are 
not resolved.&nbsp; This means that such LMOs are ill-defined, however this 
would never be significant in reactions.</p>
<p>(2) The unitary rotation of the occupied set will not allow atoms to be 
created.&nbsp; So if one LMO has a specific atom that is not present in another 
LMO, then rotation of the two LMOs will result in the loss of wavefunction in 
the second LMO.&nbsp; This is also never important but in this case because the 
loss only occurs in the tails of the LMOs.</p>
