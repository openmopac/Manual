<h1 class="auto-style1">Defining Distances in Proteins</h1>
<p class="auto-style2">Sometimes it is necessary to define an interatomic 
distance in a protein.&nbsp; For example, if one atom has to be a specific 
distance from another, or if a reaction path involving an interatomic distance 
is to be mapped, then a method must exist to specify interatomic distances.&nbsp; 
Protein geometries are normally defined entirely in Cartesian coordinates, so 
how can a specific interatomic distance be defined?&nbsp; The technique, while 
simple, involves several steps, but once learned, it is straightforward. A 
description of the technique will now be given.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Interatomic distances can only be defined using internal 
coordinates, so the first step is to replace the Cartesian coordinates of the 
second atom with the equivalent internal coordinates. It's necessary to use the 
second atom because an atom's position in internal coordinates is defined 
relative to those of atoms already defined. Only MOPAC format data sets can be 
used, i.e., PDB format data sets cannot be used; this is because optimization 
flags for a specific atom cannot be set when PDB format is used.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Using a GUI, identify the pair of atoms involved.&nbsp; 
For the first atom, call this N1, identify an atom, NA - chose a heavy atom if 
possible - that is attached to NA, call this NB, and a third atom, NC, attached 
to NB.&nbsp; Again, chose a heavy atom for NC, if possible.&nbsp; The position 
of N1 will then be defined in terms of NA, NB, and NC.&nbsp; The atom numbers of 
NB and NC can be larger than that of atom NA but they must be smaller than that 
of atom N1.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Using the GUI, measure the current distance, in &Aring;ngstroms, 
between the atoms N1 and NA, the current angle, in degrees, N1-NA-Nb, and the 
current dihedral, also in degrees, of N1-NA-NB-NC.&nbsp; Make a note of the atom 
labels, and include the atom number and Cartesian coordinates for N1, NA, NB, 
and NC.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Using an editor, edit the data set to replace the 
Cartesian coordinates of atom N1 with the internal coordinates. Replace the X 
coordinate with the interatomic distance, the Y coordinate with the angle, and 
the Z coordinate with the torsion or dihedral angle.&nbsp; After the third 
optimization flag, add the connectivity.&nbsp; Be very careful here, as atom 
numbers in atom labels might be incorrect.&nbsp; Use the Cartesian coordinates 
to verify that the correct atoms are being used.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Save the edited file, and open it using a GUI.&nbsp; 
Check that the position of atom N1 is correct (within a tenth of an &Aring;ngstrom).&nbsp; 
If it's not correct, fix the fault.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now the internal coordinate can be edited.&nbsp; If the 
interatomic distance is to be fixed, set the first optimization flag to zero. If&nbsp; 
the interatomic distance is to be smaller or greater than it was, make the 
change at this point.&nbsp; Most likely the angle and dihedral are not 
important, so set these optimization flags to one.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">If a reaction path is to be mapped, set the interatomic 
distance optimization flag to -1.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Good luck!</p>
