<tt>START_RES(<i>text</i>)</tt> </h1>
<p>&nbsp;Keyword <tt>START_RES</tt> provides information on the residue starting 
numbers and on the locations of the ends of chains.</p>
<p>Some PDB files represent two or more proteins, for example there are four 
proteins in one hemoglobin.&nbsp; At the end of each such protein there is a TER 
entry, indicating the termination of the protein chain.&nbsp; Sometimes, in a 
protein, one or more 
residues are missing.&nbsp; Missing residues are indicated in the PDB file by a 
discontinuity in the residue number in a chain. By default, when a PDB file is 
read in, all missing residues and gaps are automatically identified, and used in 
constructing the keyword <tt>START_RES</tt>. In normal work, this keyword should 
not be modified, however if there is a need to modify 
it, the following definition of the <i>text</i> is provided as a guide:</p>
<p> <tt>START_RES[=](n<sub>1</sub>[C<sub>1</sub>][ ,-][n<sub>2</sub>[C<sub>2</sub>][ ,-][n<sub>3</sub>[C<sub>3</sub>][ ,-]...]])</tt></p>
<p dir="ltr">n<sub>n</sub> is the number of the first residue in a section of contiguous 
residues in the PDB file, and C<sub>n</sub> is the chain letter.&nbsp; If two contiguous sections 
are separated by 
missing residues, then the two n<sub>n</sub> are separated by a minus sign.&nbsp; 
If the two contiguous sections are on different proteins, then the two n<sub>n</sub> 
are separated by a single space.&nbsp; Only the first residue in each chain 
needs a chain letter.</p>
<p>Thus if a PDB file consists of three proteins, A, B, and C, and A has residues 30 
31 32 33 34 38 39 40,  B has residues 44 45 46 49 50 51 55 56 57, and C has 
residues -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3, then the 
keyword would be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<tt>START_RES(30A-38 44B-49-55 -4C-3) </tt>or<tt> START_RES=(30A-38 44B-49-55 
-4C-3)</tt> (The equals sign is optional.)</p>
<p>This keyword is read by the program as follows:&nbsp;  </p>
<p>The first residue has 
residue number 30 and chain letter A.&nbsp; Subsequent residues have the same 
chain letter, and residue number increments by one on going from one residue to 
the next.&nbsp; After residue 34 there is a gap, so this set of residues would 
be 30:34.&nbsp; The next residue found, in the next piece of the same chain, is 
given the residue number 38, and the same chain letter (A), and is bonded to the 
last residue of the previous chain (residue #34).&nbsp; Subsequent residues in 
this short chain are given consecutive numbers, here 39 and 40.&nbsp; Residue 40 
marks the end of this short bit of chain.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>When <a href="pdbout.html"><tt>PDBOUT</tt></a> is present, the gap between 
"30A-38" and "44B-49-55" is used to indicate that a "TER" should be written to 
the PDB file. </p>
<p>The next complete chain starts with residue #44 and has chain letter B.&nbsp; 
This chain consists of three short bits of chain, 44:46, 49:51, and 55:57.&nbsp; 
The gaps due to missing residues are indicated by the minus sign, which shows 
that the last residue of a bit of chain is connected to the first residue of the 
next bit of chain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The third chain, C, is unusual, in that the original authors used a negative 
number, -4, for the residue number of the first residue.&nbsp; Because of this, 
the symbol for the first residue in chain C is "-4C"</p>
