<h2>
Refractive Index
</h2>
<h3><font size="4">Introduction</font></h3>
<p>For a vacuum, the refractive index is 1.000.&nbsp; This means that light
travels through a vacuum at the speed c.&nbsp; When light goes through a medium
such as glass, the time needed to travel a given distance increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The conventional way of looking at this is to say that light is slowed down as
it passes through the glass.&nbsp; An alternative, and equivalent, explanation
would be to say that the apparent distance the light has to travel has
increased.&nbsp; The extra distance can be expressed as a ratio, thus a
refractive index of 1.4 would mean that the light was slowed by a factor of 1.4
or that the distance was increased by the same factor.&nbsp; In three
dimensions, the refractive index represents the extra volume that appears to
exist when light goes through a medium. Thus if a glass had a refractive index
of 1.4, it would mean that a 10cc block of it would appear to have a volume of
14 cc, if the volume was determined using light.</p>
<p>Refractive index is related to polarizability, in that it represents the
extra volume that appears to exist when light goes through a medium.
</p>
<p>The refractive index of a solid cannot be calculated directly.&nbsp; Nor can
the polarizability of a solid be calculated, if translation vectors are used.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>How to Calculate Refractive Index</h3>
<p>The polarizability at various energies (wavelengths) can be calculated for
the cluster, using <a href="polar.html"><tt><font color="#0000ff"><u>POLAR</u></font></tt></a>,
if translation vectors are removed and the "dangling bonds" are satisfied.&nbsp;
The best atom for this is the capped bond (<a href="geometry_specification.html">Cb</a>).&nbsp;
Obviously, the calculated polarizability includes the contributions from the
surface, so the surface effects must be removed.&nbsp; This is easily done by
doing calculations on different clusters.&nbsp; Consider a cluster of size
10x10x10&Aring;.&nbsp; If this was increased to 15x15x15, the surface area (surface
effect) would increase from 6x10x10 to 6x15x15 square &Aring;ngstroms, while the
volume (what we want) would increase from 10x10x10 to 15x15x15 cubic &Aring;ngstroms.</p>
<p>Given the polarizability, <i>a</i>, and the volume, <i>V</i>,&nbsp; of the
cluster, the average refractive index, <i>n</i>,&nbsp; is readily given by <i>n</i>
= (1+<i>a</i>/<i>v</i>).&nbsp; If <a href="let.html"><tt><font color="#0000ff"><u>LET</u></font></tt></a>
is used, the system will not be re-oriented, and the individual polarizabilities
(in <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>) can be calculated. From these, the
refractive indices in different directions can be calculated.</p>
