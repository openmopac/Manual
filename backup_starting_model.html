<h1 class="auto-style1">Backup the starting model</h1>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">The starting model is, without doubt, the most important structure 
that is used in modeling protein chemistry.&nbsp; Generating the starting model 
requires a lot of work: <a href="Getting_a_starting_protein_structure.html">
getting a suitable PDB file</a>, <a href="Preparing_a_Starting_data_set.html">
adding hydrogen atoms</a> and checking all unusual features, checking 
simulation-generated and potential <a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a>, 
performing an <a href="Unconstrained_optimization.html">unconstrained geometry 
optimization</a>, and finally checking the resulting geometry once more for any 
possible anomalies or faults.&nbsp; The result of all this work should be 
three 
files, a PDB file, a normal MOPAC data set file, and a MOPAC archive file.&nbsp; 
Of these, the archive file is the most versatile, in that it contains the most useful information, and can be edited easily to make a MOPAC data set.&nbsp; In 
the archive file, &lt;file&gt;.arc, and the MOPAC data set, &lt;file&gt;.mop, the data-set should have the 
following structure:</p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">(1) A set of lines that start with an asterisk, indicating that 
they are comments.&nbsp; These lines will be used in making the start of a PDB 
file.&nbsp; Lines of this type start with PDB-type line entries, such as:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">*HEADER</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
<span class="auto-style1">*REMARK</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
<span class="auto-style1">*HELIX</span><br class="auto-style1"/>
<span class="auto-style1">*SHEET</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">If these lines are not wanted, either 
delete them or add <a href="nocomments.html"><tt>NOCOMMENTS</tt></a> to the next 
data-set.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">(2) The normal keyword line.&nbsp; In the starting model, this will 
normally consist of the keyword </span> <a href="start_res.html"><tt>
START_RES</tt></a><span class="auto-style1">.&nbsp; This keyword will be generated by 
ADD-H and unless there is a need to precisely reproduce the labeling of the 
original PDB file, specifically the "TER"s, it can be deleted.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">(3) A title line.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">(4) A comment line</p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">(5) The complete geometry of the system.&nbsp; Each atom is labeled 
with information that allows the original PDB atom labels to be constructed.</p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">(6) The standard blank line that indicates the end of the data set.</p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">Because so much effort is required to make a starting model, it is 
important that the starting model should be copied and the copy put in a safe 
location.&nbsp; Of course, the starting model should be given a very descriptive 
name, e.g. "Crambin 1CBN Starting Model -3530kcal per mole.arc"&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
safe location could be a folder that contains only starting models.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">A useful step is to include the heat of formation in the name.&nbsp; 
Protein modeling assumes that, given two different conformers, the lowest energy 
system is the more correct.&nbsp; So by including the &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style1"><sub>f</sub> 
of the starting model in its name, the any potentially better model, i.e., a 
model with a lower&nbsp;&Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style1"><sub>f</sub> can readily 
be compared with the reference starting model.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">During modeling work, there is the possibility that the system 
might unexpectedly drop in energy, as a salt bridge forms or a strained 
structure relaxes.&nbsp; If this happens, then the cause of the change should be 
simulated using the starting model. If the &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style1"><sub>f</sub> 
is lowered by more than, e.g., 2 or 3 kcal/mol, then the current starting model 
should be replaced by a new starting model that has a new name.&nbsp; The old starting model should 
not be deleted at this point - it might be needed later on. </span> </p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">At first sight, the possibility that many months of hard work would 
be invalidated by a change in the starting model might be depressing, but if a 
careful record has been maintained for all the interesting structures - 
intermediates, transition states, vibrational frequencies, etc. - then these structures can usually be easily modified to 
incorporate the change and re-run.</p>
<p class="auto-style1" dir="ltr">Of course, it is much better to have a good starting model to begin 
with!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style1">The PDB and MOPAC formats are readily interconverted: to convert a MOPAC format into a PDB format, run 
a MOPAC data set using keywords
</span>
<a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> <a href="pdbout.html"><tt>
PDBOUT</tt></a><span class="auto-style1"> 
only.&nbsp; This will generate the PDB format.&nbsp; To convert a PDB format 
into a MOPAC format, simply open the PDB using MOPAC; this will automatically 
generate a MOPAC data set, this can be found in the file &lt;file&gt;.arc.</span></p>
