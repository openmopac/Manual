<tt>STATIC</tt>
</h1>
The static polarizability is calculated.  An electric field gradient is
applied to the system, and the response is calculated.  The dipole and
polarizability are calculated two different ways, from the change in
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> and from the change in dipole.  A measure of the imprecision of the calculation
can be obtained by comparing the two quantities.  Greater precision can be
obtained by increasing the precision of the SCF (<tt>RELSCF=0.1</tt> or
<tt>RELSCF=0.01</tt>).
<p>In 2004, the polarizability volume reported was modified by the use of
<a href="additive_corrections.html">additive corrections</a>.</p>
<p>
In <tt>STATIC</tt>, 37 or 38 SCF calculations are involved.  The polarizability
involves 36 calculations, one for each electric field.  The fields are +X, -X,
+2X, -2X, +Y, -Y, +2Y, -2Y, +X+Y, -X+Y, -X-Y, +X-Y, +2X+2Y, -2X+2Y, -2X-2Y,
+2X-2Y, +Z, -Z, +2Z, -2Z, +X+Z, -X+Z, -X-Z, +X-Z, +2X+2Z, -2X+2Z, -2X-2Z,
+2X-2Z, +Y+Z, -Y+Z, -Y-Z, +Y-Z, +2Y+2Z, -2Y+2Z, -2Y-2Z, and +2Y-2Z.
These are used in the construction of a three by three secular matrix, which
is then diagonalized, giving the orthogonal polarizabilities.
