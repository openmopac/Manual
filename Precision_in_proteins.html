Precision in Proteins </h1>
<p class="auto-style1">
When default settings are used, the precision of protein calculations is in the 
order of 1 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; Note that this is precision, not 
accuracy; errors in accuracy can be in the order of hundreds of kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; 
Precision is a measure of how reproducible a given calculation is.&nbsp; 
Obviously, if the calculation was completely precise, the same job would give 
the same results on all operating systems, and, more important, give the same 
results when insignificant changes are made to the starting data.&nbsp; In 
practice, small changes in input data can give rise to significant changes in 
the results.&nbsp; This is obviously not acceptable when comparing relative 
energies of closely-related systems.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
Several techniques and strategies are available to increase precision.&nbsp; 
Using these, particularly minimizing the domain to be optimized, can result in a 
reduction in errors in precision to about 0.02 to 0.05 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<h3>
Use a good starting model</h3>
<p>
When making a starting model, geometry optimization should be run until there is 
no significant change in <span class="auto-style2">D</span>H<sub>f</sub>.&nbsp; If this is not done, then when 
changes are made to the geometry, a mutation or a step in a reaction mechanism, 
and the geometry optimized, the original and changed systems might optimize to 
significantly different final geometries, even if the change is relatively 
small.&nbsp; This can happen if a hydrogen bond that should exist forms during 
one calculation and not during the other.&nbsp; A suitable strategy would be to 
use keywords <tt><a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=3</a> <a href="t=n.html">T=2W</a></tt>, and monitor the optimization periodically.&nbsp; When 
the <span class="auto-style2">D</span>H<sub>f</sub> stops dropping, use the 
<a href="shut.html">SHUT</a> command to stop the run.&nbsp; When the job ends, 
edit the output file, &lt;name&gt;.out, to make a new data set that uses the last 
geometry output.&nbsp; This geometry represents the structure with the lowest 
calculated <span class="auto-style2">D</span>H<sub>f</sub>, not necessarily the 
last structure calculated.</p>
<h3>
Make similar systems as similar as possible</h3>
<p>
When comparing closely-related systems, start with one of the two systems, 
optimize it as completely as possible, then make the smallest change possible to 
make the other system.&nbsp; The idea here is that when the geometry 
optimization of the changed system starts, the geometry should (a) be as similar 
as possible to the original system, and (b) be as near as possible to the final 
geometry. For example, if a hydrogen atom is being migrated from one site to 
another, the starting position of the hydrogen atom in the new site should be as 
good as possible - bond length within a few percent, and pointing in the right 
direction.&nbsp; If possible, avoid "cut and paste" of large pieces of protein - 
the joins are almost certain to be poor. Instead, edit one or more individual 
atoms to achieve the desired modification.</p>
<h3>
Minimize the domain to be optimized</h3>
<p>
If unconstrained optimizations are carried out on two closely-related systems, 
there is a high probability that small changes far from the site of interest 
would introduce energy changes in the order of 1 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> - 
this is the origin of the large default precision. Such energy changes could 
make any deductions worthless.&nbsp; To prevent this happening, optimize the 
geometry using only 
the minimum set of atoms by using <a href="opt_label.html"><tt>OPT(text)</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
This technique has the added advantage of requiring much less time than a full 
optimization.</p>
