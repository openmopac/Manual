<h2>Piezoelectric Effect
</h2>
<p>The piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon exhibited by certain crystals of
expansion in one direction (axis) and contraction in another direction, as the
result of an applied electric field.&nbsp; Also, an applied mechanical strain in
one direction causes electric charges of opposite signs to appear on different
faces of the crystal.&nbsp; This phenomenon can be modeled by simply altering
the different translation vectors of a solid.&nbsp; That is, altering the Tv
bond-length from the optimized value would simulate stress in that direction.
After geometry optimization, with the Tv bond length not optimized, the change
in electric charges from the values for the relaxed crystal would be a measure
of the piezoelectric effect..</p>
<p>This type of phenomenon might be easier to model using Cartesian coordinates.
