<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">Modeling proteins and Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions 
(<a href="proteins.html">Back to "Proteins"</a>)</font></h1>
<h2 class="auto-style4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="auto-style4">For the purposes of 
investigating protein behavior, it is useful to regard the program MOPAC as a 
complete laboratory, with all the utilities and tools needed for modeling 
protein behavior.&nbsp; As with tools in any laboratory, a certain level of 
skill is needed; a potential user who just wants to look at an enzyme-catalyzed 
reaction and is not willing to prepare a suitable model will inevitably be 
disappointed.&nbsp; Potential users must be willing to do two things: first, to 
acquire the skills necessary for manipulating the complicated models, and 
second, to construct and use such models.&nbsp; These are difficult tasks, and a 
lot of patience is required.&nbsp; To help with them, MOPAC provides a set of 
utilities to assist in building models and for detecting errors that occur 
during this process.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">Any researcher who wants to use MOPAC for modeling 
proteins and is willing to invest the effort to learn how to do that has a right 
to expect the program to work as described in this Manual.&nbsp; Obviously there 
are faults in MOPAC, but a serious effort has been made, taking more than a 
year, to check that the program works correctly, and to simplify identifying and 
correcting faults in protein data-sets. The current on-line manual and MOPAC 
program are the culmination of that effort.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style4">Why should an 
experimentalist use computational chemistry modeling tools?&nbsp; Probably the 
most important reason is that they provide an alternative to the other two 
approaches: experiment and understanding.&nbsp; To give a simple example, 
consider an X-ray structure of a protein.&nbsp; This structure is physics, not 
chemistry, and almost all (well over 90%) of the structures examined thus far 
have had mild to severe errors when looked at from a chemical point of view.&nbsp; 
Examples would be unrealistic single bond lengths, e.g., C-C bonds of length 
~1.1 &Aring; instead of the expected 1.5 &Aring;,
unrealistic non-covalently bonded distances, and simple errors such as a C-NH<sub>2</sub> 
being mistaken for a C=O and </span><span class="auto-style5">vice versa</span><span class="auto-style4">. These errors can be detected 
using MOPAC, and, more important, they can be corrected.&nbsp; The result is a 
structure that is much more chemically realistic than the starting PDB 
structure.&nbsp; Put another way, the result of simply building a model of a 
protein is a structure that is more realistic, i.e., nearer to the structure of 
the biochemical that occurs in nature, than anything available from any other 
source. </span></p>
<p class="auto-style4">To reiterate, for a model to be useful it must be 
realistic.&nbsp; When an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, the energy changes 
involved are often very small, frequently less than the energy involved in 
making a single hydrogen bond.&nbsp; If there is a fault in the model that might 
cause it to be in a high-energy state, and later on in the simulation that fault 
corrected itself, the resulting energy change would more than likely invalidate 
all the work that had gone before.&nbsp;It is important, therefore, to make sure that 
the starting model is as error free as possible.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and 
without exception, all data sources for protein structures (including the most 
important one: the Protein Data Bank) have limitations.&nbsp; These range from 
minor faults - ones that were previously regarded as unimportant - such as 
missing hydrogen atoms, to quite severe geometric errors, such as carbon-carbon 
single bonds having a bond-length of less than 1.4 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; Therefore, before any work can be done, a realistic model of the 
protein must be constructed.&nbsp; This operation involves several steps, and 
requires great care to be exercised to ensure that the resulting model is as 
good as possible. </p>
