Preconditioning Proteins </h1>
<h2 align="left">
Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">
The <a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a> function provides a very powerful tool for the study of proteins, in 
particular globular proteins.&nbsp; Only systems that can be described with a 
closed shell wavefunction can be modeled.&nbsp; In addition to proteins composed 
only from the standard 20 residues, more complicated proteins, such as 
bacteriorhodopsin, myoglobin, 
cytochrome-P450, and hemoglobin can also be modeled.&nbsp; Organometallic 
enzymes, particularly those involving the heme system, are normally regarded as 
open shell, but their structures can apparently be represented with good 
accuracy using the PM6 RHF method.&nbsp; No problems should occur 
with even quite large systems: structures of systems of almost 10,000 atoms have 
been optimized in a few CPU weeks.&nbsp; However, problems are likely to 
occur in systems with significantly more than 10,000 atoms. </p>
<p align="left">
The most difficult operation in calculating protein structures involves 
preparing the data set.&nbsp; None of the common sources of reference data for 
protein geometries are suitable for use as a data set.&nbsp; This includes, in 
particular, the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a> 
(the PDB). While all the proteins used in developing the MOZYME function were 
obtained from the PDB, in every case extensive work had to be done in preparing 
a data set that could be run using MOZYME.&nbsp; Common deficiencies or features 
that make the raw PDB files unsuitable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">
For most PDB entries, hydrogen atoms are missing.&nbsp; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">
There might be positional disorder (groups of atoms can occupy two possible 
conformations, and the PDB file records both)</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">
There might be structural disorder (different residues in the same position in 
the sequence, e.g. ILE and LEU might both be present a fraction of the time in a 
given position.)</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">
Residues might be missing.&nbsp; (These are usually only those residues on the 
surface of a protein that are not involved in activity, and are not tightly 
bound.)</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">
Exotic atoms might be present, e.g. Hg, Sm, or La.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
All these features and faults must be addressed before a MOZYME run can be 
started.</p>
<h2 align="left">
Recommended Sequence for Preconditioning a Protein Data Set</h2>
<p align="left">
1.
Before starting, get a copy of the data set representing the protein of 
interest; the PDB is an excellent source for such data files. </p>
<p align="left">
2.
The first operation is to resolve positional and structural disorder.&nbsp; Most 
GUIs that can handle PDB files will be able to do this when the data set is read 
in.&nbsp; Look at the data set.&nbsp; If there are gaps in the residue sequence, 
find out whether these represent genuine gaps or represent missing data.&nbsp; 
Normally, gaps are not very important, and can safely be ignored. The rare case 
is when there are one or more residues missing inside the protein - this 
normally would require the missing residues to be replaced.</p>
<p align="left">
3.
If necessary, add hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Even if the protein already has hydrogen 
atoms, quite often several of them are missing.&nbsp; During this operation, 
several problems can occur. The commonest complications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">
Too many or too few hydrogen atoms are added to a heavy atom resulting in the 
wrong saturation.&nbsp; Thus if a phenyl group has excess hydrogen atoms, it 
might be converted to a cyclohexane.</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">
Check hetero groups carefully.&nbsp; Thus heme should have the correct porphyrin 
ring structure, and small hetero groups, such as carbon monoxide and molecular 
oxygen, should not have "extra" hydrogen atoms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
4.
Prepare a MOPAC data set; use Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; In the first 
run, use keywords <a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> and 
<a href="pdbout.html"><tt>PDBOUT</tt></a> or <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
Inspect 
the resulting structure using JSmol or other GUI.&nbsp; There should be no unknown residues.&nbsp; If 
there are, and you're sure that they are correct, use keyword 
<a href="xeno.html"><tt>XENO</tt></a> to re-define the 
unknown residue or heterogroup. This step is 
not essential, but if it's done then potential problems associated with the 
unusual residue can be more rapidly located, if it's not done, the unknown residue 
or heterogroup will be indicated as RES or UNK</p>
<p align="left">
5. Prepare a new data set.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Run this set using <tt><a href="cutoff.html">CUTOFF=6</a></tt>, <a href="gnorm.html"><tt>GNORM=30</tt></a>,
<a href="nooptx.html"><tt>NOOPT</tt></a>, and <a href="opth.html"><tt>OPT-H</tt></a>.&nbsp; That will optimize the positions of 
all the hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p align="left">
6. After the job has run, use the .arc file to make a new data set.&nbsp; Run 
this new set with keywords <tt>0SCF </tt>and <tt>PDBOUT</tt>.&nbsp; Examine the resulting file to 
see if any hydrogen atoms have migrated to form salt bridges.&nbsp; If they 
have, examine the bridge to see if it is chemically sensible.</p>
<p align="left">
7. If everything is still okay, edit the data set to change all optimization 
flags from 0 to 1, and re-run with keywords <tt>CUTOFF=6 GNORM=30 
<a href="t=n.html">T=1w</a></tt> plus a <tt><a href="CVB.html">CVB</a> </tt>
or <tt><a href="setpi.html">SETPI</a> </tt> keyword, if necessary. </p>
<p align="left">
8. If desired, add all the PDB preamble (everything in the PDB file from 
"HEADER" to the line before the first atom) to the data set as comments.&nbsp; 
Put an asterisk at the start of each comment to indicate that it is a comment.&nbsp; 
If desired, add the keyword&nbsp; <tt>
START_RES(<i>text</i>)</tt>.&nbsp; If the preamble, and <tt>
START_RES(<i>text</i>)</tt> if necessary, is added, then when PDBOUT is used, 
the resulting file will be almost indistinguishable from a regular PDB file. </p>
<p align="left">
9. Once the job finishes, edit the ARC file to make a new data set with 
keywords&nbsp; <tt>GNORM=10 T=2w</tt> plus a <tt>CVB </tt>
or <tt>SETPI </tt>as necessary, and re-run.</p>
<p align="left">
10. Edit the ARC file to make a preconditioned starting MOPAC data set.&nbsp; 
This can be used for following a reaction path, finding a transition state, etc.&nbsp; </p>
