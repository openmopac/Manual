<tt>RESEQ</tt>
</h2>
According to the PDB format, atoms in a protein are specified starting with
the nitrogen of the -NH<sub>2</sub> end and ending with the atoms at the -COOH end.
<tt>RESEQ</tt> will re-arrange the atoms into the standard PDB sequence.  
<tt>RESEQ</tt> is useful particularly after adding hydrogen atoms, see below.  Because
<tt>RESEQ</tt> changes the order of the atoms, further work is not
possible, and the calculation is stopped after the new geometry is printed.<p>
A useful additional keyword is <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>; this generates a 
simple HTML web-page and a PDB file in a form that is useful for 
displaying protein structures using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/">JSmol</a>.</p>
<p>
When <a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt></a> or <a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a> is used, 
changes are made to the number or locations of hydrogen atoms. In these two 
cases,   
<tt>RESEQ</tt> will be run automatically unless <tt><a href="noreseq.html">NORESEQ</a> </tt>is present, so there is no 
need to add   
<tt>RESEQ</tt>.&nbsp; If the number or location of hydrogen atoms is changed 
outside MOPAC,   
<tt>RESEQ</tt> should be used.&nbsp; If a raw PDB file, i.e., a file from 
the Protein Data Bank, is used as a data set, then hydrogen atoms will be added 
automatically, and   
<tt>RESEQ</tt> will then be run automatically.&nbsp; To stop   
<tt>RESEQ</tt> being run, use a MOPAC data set, i.e., a data set with keywords, and add 
<tt>NORESEQ</tt>. </p>
<p><tt>RESEQ</tt>&nbsp;sometimes re-arranges the atoms 
in unexpected ways.&nbsp; Consider phenylalanine, for example.&nbsp; In it, the 
sequence of atoms is uniquely defined except for C<sub><span class="b">&delta;</span>1</sub> 
and C<sub><span class="b">&delta;</span>2</sub>.&nbsp; This means that either one 
of these atoms might be chosen at random to be C<sub><span class="b">&delta;</span>1</sub>, 
and the choice might be different from that used in the starting data set.&nbsp; 
This should not cause a problem when resequenced proteins are compared using the
<a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a> option, because, during the calculation of RMS 
difference, ambiguities of this type are automatically resolved.</p>
<p>Also, if the protein has gaps where residues are missing, <tt>RESEQ</tt> might put the 
fragments into the wrong order, particularly if the residues in the protein have 
been re-arranged as the result of earlier operations.&nbsp; If the 
order of fragments is incorrect, use <tt><a href="CVB.html">CVB</a></tt> to make dummy bonds that bridge the gaps 
and re-run. 
Suitable atoms are the N terminus of one residue and the C of carboxyl of the other 
residue.</p>
<p>A <a href="Resequence.zip">complete worked example of RESEQ</a> can be 
downloaded. This shows how <tt>RESEQ</tt> can re-arrange the sequence of atoms 
into the standard PDB sequence.&nbsp; The example is used in validating MOPAC, 
and is much more complicated than most cases users are likely to encounter.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Compliance with PDB conventions</h3>
<p>The following operations are performed when <tt>RESEQ</tt>&nbsp;is used:</p>
<p>Within each residue, the order of atoms is: First, the four backbone atoms, 
N-C<span class="auto-style1">a</span>-C-O, then the side-chain non-hydrogen 
atoms, then the terminal oxygen atom, OXT, (if present), then the hydrogen 
atoms, in the order in which they occur.&nbsp; One exception is that the HXT 
atom, if present, might not be the last hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>Heterogroups are positioned after all protein and isolated amino acid 
moieties. </p>
