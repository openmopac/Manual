<h1 class="auto-style1">Choosing a format: MOPAC or PDB</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">The two main formats used by MOPAC are the native MOPAC 
format 
and the PDB format, so a reasonable question would be, "Which is better?"&nbsp; 
The easiest way to answer this is to compare the features of the MOPAC and PDB 
formats as they apply to data sets that can be run using MOPAC.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">PDB format</h2>
<h3 class="auto-style1">Advantages:</h3>
<p class="auto-style1">Exact compatibility with the PDB format.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style1">Disadvantages:</h3>
<p><span class="auto-style1">The user cannot specify individual atoms for optimization, however sets of 
atoms can be selected using </span> <a href="nooptx.html"><tt>
NOOPT</tt></a><span class="auto-style1">,&nbsp; </span>
<a href="optx.html"><tt>OPT-H</tt></a><span class="auto-style1">, etc.&nbsp; 
</span> <br class="auto-style1"/><span class="auto-style1">Coordinates are 
limited to three decimals, so calculated properties would be slightly different 
to those predicted if 
the MOPAC format were to be used.&nbsp; These differences are quite small, a few tenths of a 
Kcal/mol for chymotrypsin, and if a geometry optimization is involved, are 
really quite unimportant.</span></p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">MOPAC format</h2>
<h3 class="auto-style1">Advantages:</h3>
<p class="auto-style1">Very fine control of geometry optimization is possible, for example gradient 
minimization of the individual atoms involved in a reaction can be specified.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style1">Disadvantages:</h3>
<p class="auto-style1">The geometry does not include all information that is 
present in the PDB geometry.&nbsp; Extra information, such as the positions of 
missing residues and chain ends and chain letters must be given by keyword <a href="start_res.html"><tt>START_RES</tt></a>&nbsp; at the start of the data set.&nbsp; This 
extra information is only needed if an exact comparison with the original PDB 
file has to be made.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Suggested use of PDB and MOPAC formats</h2>
<p><span class="auto-style1">Set up data sets for modeling using the MOPAC format.&nbsp; This is easy to 
use, and when atom numbers are replaced by <a href="atom_numbers.html">PDB or 
Jmol labels</a>, editing optimization flags and  adding or 
deleting atoms is straightforward.&nbsp; Include keyword </span> <a href="pdbout.html"><tt>
PDBOUT</tt></a> <span class="auto-style1">or&nbsp;<a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>, 
so that the job will produce a PDB file suitable for use with a GUI. This gives 
the best of both formats: MOPAC format is easy to edit, and PDB format is easy 
to use with GUIs.</span></p>
