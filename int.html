<tt>INT</tt>
</h1>
Regardless of what type of coordinates are used in the data set, <tt>INT</tt>
will force all the coordinates to be internal coordinates.  Atom 1 is,
by definition, always defined in Cartesian coordinates.
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>If&nbsp; <tt>INT</tt> is used, the optimization flags are not changed.
  Therefore, before running a system with&nbsp;<tt>INT</tt> all the
  optimization flags should be set to "1", except for atoms 1, 2, and 3.
  For atom 1, all optimization flags should be set to "0", for atom 2, the
  second and third flags should be "0", and for atom 3 the third flag should be
  "0".</li>
<li>Be very careful if some atoms have optimization flags set to "0".&nbsp; If 
  the geometry supplied is in Cartesian coordinates, and an atom, say atom 10, 
  has all three optimization flags set to "0", then that means "Do not change 
  the Cartesian coordinates of atom 10."&nbsp;&nbsp; If that atom is converted 
  to internal coordinates, the optimization flags will still be zero, but now 
  the definition changes to "Do not change the bond length, angle, and dihedral 
  of atom 10, with reference to the atoms used for the connectivity."&nbsp; Now 
  atom 10 will move if the atom it is attached to moves. This is fundamentally 
  different from the Cartesian coordinate definition.</li>
<li>Any dummy atoms are automatically deleted if <tt>INT</tt> is
  present.&nbsp; This is because the first step in running <tt>INT</tt> is to
  convert the system to Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; This involved deleting any
  dummy atoms.&nbsp; The next step involves conversion from Cartesian to
  internal coordinates.</li>
<li>&nbsp;<tt>INT</tt> is a rapid and efficient way of deleting atoms from a
  molecule that is defined using internal coordinates.&nbsp; Re-label the atoms
  to be deleted as dummy atoms, and run <tt>INT</tt> with <tt>
<a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a>.</tt> </li>
</ul>
