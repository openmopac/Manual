<h1 class="auto-style1">What Program BZ can do (<a href="Program_BZ.html">Back</a>)</h1>
<p class="auto-style2">Program BZ is designed to be used mainly for exploring 
the Brillouin zone of a crystalline solid.&nbsp; It can be used for working with 
the Brillouin zone for one-dimensional polymers such as polyethylene or 
cellulose, and for two-dimensional systems such as graphene, but the main use is 
for mapping the Brillouin zone of organic, organometallic, and inorganic 
solids.&nbsp;For this reason all the following discussion will be restricted to 
three-dimensional solids.</p>
<h3>Structures in <em>k</em>-space</h3>
<p class="auto-style2">The volume within the Brillouin zone is referred to as
<em>k</em>-space. Several regions in <em>k</em>-space are of interest, and all 
of these can be examined using BZ: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Surfaces</strong>: A surface can be defined 
	as a two-dimensional plane in <em>k</em>-space.&nbsp; The most important of 
	these are the various surfaces of the Brillouin zone itself, and certain 
	cross-sections of the Brillouin zone; these cross-sections typically include 
	the center of the Brillouin zone, i.e., <em>k</em>-space coordinate&nbsp; 
	(0.0, 0.0, 0.0).&nbsp; Surfaces can be of any size, although most 
	interesting features are in the first Brillouin zone. Typically, only one 
	energy surface would be generated in a given plot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Lines</strong>: The shape of a Brillouin zone 
	can be represented by a set of lines.&nbsp; Those on the surface define the 
	limits of the first Brillouin zone.&nbsp; Another set of lines go from the 
	center of the Brillouin zone to a point on the surface, either a vertex or 
	the center of a polygon.&nbsp; These lines and others, e.g., a line from the 
	center of a polygon to a vertex, or a line that is not related to any 
	specific feature, can be generated.&nbsp; Each point on a line contains all 
	the energy levels for that point. A set of contiguous lines will be referred 
	to as a "walk", as in "The walk from &Gamma; to X 
	to W to L to &Gamma;"&nbsp; The band-structure 
	of a solid is most commonly represented by one or more walks in <em>k</em>-space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Points</strong>.&nbsp; The properties of an 
	individual point in <em>k</em>-space can be calculated.&nbsp; In addition to the 
	energy levels, the eigenvalues, at the point being examined, the symmetry 
	properties of the associated eigenvectors can also be generated.&nbsp; This 
	does require symmetry information to be supplied <em>via</em> a file named 
	&lt;file&gt;.ops.&nbsp; The symmetry group at a given point is called the "little 
	group."&nbsp; Some little groups are isomorphous with a point-group, some 
	other little groups have no equivalent point group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of energy band structure</h3>
<h4>Electronic</h4>
<p>Electronic band structures are calculated using the Fock matrix from a MOPAC 
calculation.&nbsp; This is the simplest type of band-structure. The number of 
energy bands is equal to the number of atomic orbitals in the primitive unit 
cell, i.e., the smallest block that can generate the solid using only 
translations.</p>
<h4>Phonon</h4>
<p>Vibrational band structures can be calculated if a <a href="force.html"><tt>FORCE</tt></a> calculation that 
includes the <a href="mers.html"><tt>MERS</tt></a> keyword is run. The mass-weighted Hessian matrix generated in 
MOPAC is then written to &lt;file&gt;.brz.</p>
<h3>Symmetry operations</h3>
<p>If symmetry operations are supplied, <em>via</em> a file &lt;file&gt;.ops, then the 
electronic energy or phonon matrix is symmetrized.&nbsp; In principle, these 
matrices should already have the correct symmetry, but small deviations occur 
due to incomplete geometry optimization and to the use of finite numerical 
precision in constructing the matrices, in particular the phonon matrix.&nbsp; 
Symmetrizing the energy matrix results in the elimination of small artifacts, 
such as bands that should cross having a small band-gap.</p>
<p>When points are calculated, the characters of the symmetry operations of the 
associated eigenvectors are generated.&nbsp; In diamond, for example, at the
&Gamma; point, each eigenvector belongs to an 
irreducible representation of the little group that is isomorphous with 
point-group Oh. At the X point, all irreducible representations are two-fold 
degenerate.</p>
<p>In general, and with the notable exception of the Identity operation, 
characters of eigenvectors are complex, and the imaginary component represents 
the momentum of the <em>k</em>-point.</p>
<h3>Graphical representation</h3>
<p>BZ is an interactive program.&nbsp; While it's running, the band-structure, 
either a walk or a surface, is generated&nbsp; so that you can see what the 
results look like.&nbsp; This band structure can be captured using "snipping 
tool" or by screen capture.&nbsp; The band structure is also written to a file 
in a form that is suitable for use by Excel.</p>
<h3>Run in non-interactive mode</h3>
<p>As an alternative to typing data interactively, a file can be written that 
contains all the typed responses.&nbsp; Thus if the first response is the number 
"1" followed by (return), then the file would have as the first line the number 
1.&nbsp; Generating an aesthetically pleasing band-structure takes some 
trial-and-error.&nbsp; If the keystrokes that were used in making such a graphic 
are put into a file, , and when such a </p>
