applied to a geometry.&nbsp; The most important are:</p>

</ul>
<h2 align="left"><a name="fix_Cartesian">Cartesian</a> coordinates can be fixed 
by setting the appropriate optimization flags to zero.</h2>
<p align="left">Any coordinate, internal or Cartesian, can be optimized if the 
optimization flag is set to "1" and the coordinate is not otherwise defined, for 
example by <a href="symmetry.html"><tt>SYMMETRY</tt></a>.&nbsp; This flexibility applies 
to all atoms, including atoms 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp; If the coordinates of atom 1 
are flagged to be optimized, and atom 1 has no connectivity (the usual 
situation), then it is defined in Cartesian coordinates and its position can 
change during a geometry optimization. If atom 2 has a connectivity, then 
setting the angle or dihedral is meaningless, and these will be turned off 
before the calculation starts.&nbsp; The same applied to the dihedral of atom 3, 
if it, too, is defined in internal coordinates.</p>
<p align="left">In this example, an acetylene molecule is oriented along the "z" 
axis, and the second carbon atom is fixed in space at coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 
1.0). This calculation is most easily set up using Cartesian rather than 
internal coordinates. Acetylene is perfectly linear, so the "x" and "y" 
coordinates can be fixed at 0.0.&nbsp; On optimizing this system, carbon atom 1 
would move down along the "z" axis, in order from the C-C distance to increase 
from 1.0 <font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;</font>ngstroms. </p>
<pre> PM6
 Acetylene oriented along the "z" axis, 
 Atom 2 is fixed at coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
  C     0.00000000 +0   0.00000000 +0   0.00000000 +1 
  C     0.00000000 +0   0.00000000 +0   1.00000000 +0 
  H     0.00000000 +0   0.00000000 +0   2.00000000 +1 
  H     0.00000000 +0   0.00000000 +0  -1.00000000 +1  </pre>
Freezing Cartesian coordinates is useful when positioning charged species in an 
electric field, for example a fluoride ion at coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) when a 
field of 1V per <font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;</font>ngstrom is applied along 
the "z" direction.&nbsp; Less common is the use of Cartesian coordinates in 
small systems.<h2 align="left"><a name="Internal_coordinates">Internal coordinates</a> can be fixed by setting the appropriate 
optimization flags to zero.</h2>
<p align="left">Consider chloromethane, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, in which two 
constraints are applied: the C-Cl distance is fixed at 1.7
<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;ngstroms, and one C-H distance is to be fixed at 
1.1 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; The data set, in internal coordinates, might look like 
this:</font></p>
<pre>  PM6
Methyl chloride, C-Cl distance defined as 1.7 Angstroms,
 One C-H distance defined as 1.1 Angstroms
 Cl         0.0 +0    0.0000000 +0    0.0000000 +0                    
  C         1.7 +0    0.0000000 +0    0.0000000 +0    1    0    0

  H         1.1 +0  109.2843786 +1  120.0000000 +1    2    1    3   
  H         1.0 +1  109.2843786 +1 -120.0000000 +1    2    1    3  
</pre> 
In this system, there are only two constraints although there are eight 
optimization flags set to zero.&nbsp; This is because six of the optimization 
flags are for the three trivial translations (atom 1) and three trivial 
rotations (atoms 2 and 3)<h2 align="left"><a name="Cartesian_symmetry">Cartesian</a> coordinates can be set equal using symmetry</h2>
<p align="left">This is a rarely used option. An example is given in Figure 2 of <tt> <a href="symmetry.html">SYMMETRY</a>.</tt></p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Internal_symmetry">Internal</a> coordinates can be set equal by using symmetry</h2>
<p align="left">Many small molecules have symmetry in that various bond lengths 
or angles or dihedrals are equal, or are simply related.&nbsp; For an example, 
see Figure 1 of <a href="symmetry.html"> <tt> SYMMETRY</tt></a>.&nbsp; If symmetry is used, 
and a dependent coordinate is flagged for optimization, the flag will be turned 
off before the calculation is started.</p>
<h2 align="left">An interatomic distance can be set to a <a name="multiple">multiple</a> of another 
interatomic distance</h2>
<p align="left">In some solids, particularly the binary solids such as NaCl or 
CsCl, the number of independent geometric variables is small.&nbsp; In the cases 
just mentioned, the number is precisely one.&nbsp; By setting up a 
symmetry-constrained calculation involving only one variable, the computational 
effort required for geometry optimization can be reduced considerably.&nbsp; An 
example of the steps involved in setting up such a calculation are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">First, set up the Large Unit Cell (LUC) system for NaCl in 
internal coordinates, see <a href="tv.html">Tv</a>..&nbsp; For a 3 by 3 by 3 LUC 
constructed using <a href="makpol.html"><tt>MAKPOL</tt></a>, the resulting
<a href="mopac_examples/solids/NaCl_no_symmetry.mop">data set</a> has 108 NaCl 
units (Z=4).</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Run a 0SCF calculation with <a href="autosym.html"><tt>AUTOSYM</tt></a>..&nbsp; 
Edit the resulting arc file to make a new data set.&nbsp; During this process, 
change every angle optimization flag to zero - all the angles are 
symmetry-defined by the space-group, and therefore should not be optimized.</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">There are five interatomic distances that are flagged for 
optimization, but all of them are related to the distance between atoms 1 and 2, 
that is, to the bond-length of atom 2.&nbsp; This distance, 2.82<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;, 
can be used to symmetry-define all the other distances using symmetry function 
19.&nbsp; Starting with the second unique bond-length, 3.988&Aring;, divide that 
distance by the reference distance to give a ration of 1.4142.&nbsp; This is 
then used in constructing the symmetry function:<br/>
2 19 1.4142 3.&nbsp; <br/>
This function is put at the start of the symmetry functions, just after the 
Z-matrix.&nbsp; The optimization flag for the bond-length of atom 3 can then set 
to zero, as it is now symmetry defined to that of atom 2.&nbsp; The same process 
is then done for the remaining three distances.&nbsp; In each case, the 
multiplier is an easily recognizable number:&nbsp; 2<sup>1/2</sup>, 3<sup>1/2</sup>, 
2, and 6.&nbsp; </font></p></li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The number of optimization flags in 
the new <a href="mopac_examples/solids/NaCl.mop">symmetry-defined data-set</a> 
having now been reduced to exactly one, geometry optimization can be completed 
in one line-search.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 align="left"><a name="DRC">An atom can be frozen </a>in a DRC</h2>
<p align="left">In a DRC, atoms move in response to the forces acting on them.&nbsp; 
For a given force, the heavier atoms move less than light atoms.&nbsp; If, for 
any reason, an atom needs to be frozen, set its apparent weight to a large 
number.&nbsp; For example, if a carbon atom should be fixed, replace the symbol 
"C" by "C9999999" or "C1.d12" or other mass.&nbsp; The frozen atom will still 
move, but not as much as an ordinary atom. To verify that the frozen atom is in 
fact not moving, use <a href="large.html"><tt>LARGE=-1</tt> </a></p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Individual_internal_coordinates">Individual internal coordinates</a> can be fixed in a Cartesian 
geometry optimization</h2>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Because large molecule geometries are normally defined in 
Cartesian coordinates, it might seem difficult to lock individual bond-lengths or angles 
so 
that their values cannot be modified during the optimization.&nbsp; The answer 
is to define individual atoms using internal coordinates.&nbsp; Suppose that, in 
a large molecule, hydrogen atom 3000 needs to be defined as being 1.1
<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring; from oxygen atom 2999.&nbsp; Then using a 
graphics package, locate H3000 and O2999, and two other atoms that could be used 
in defining the angle and dihedral in an internal coordinate connectivity.&nbsp; 
Suitable atoms might be the atom O2999 is connected to (e.g. C2967) and the next 
atom (e.g. N2960).&nbsp; Of course, any atoms could be used provided their 
atom-number is lower than the atom being defined, i.e. here lower than 3000.&nbsp; 
Once the four atoms (here H3000, O2999, C2967, and N2960) are identified, work 
out the angle and dihedral.&nbsp; Use these data in constructing the internal 
coordinate definition for H3000.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the H3000-O2999-C2967 angle was 
120&deg;, and the H3000-O2999-C2967-N2960 torsion was 180&deg;, then the position of the 
hydrogen atom with a fixed O-H distance would be:</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">H 1.1 0 120 1 180 1 2999 
2976 2960</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">If the angle needed to be 
fixed, then the line would be:</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">H 1.1 1 120 0 180 1 2999 
2976 2960</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">and so on.&nbsp; There is 
no restriction on the number of internal coordinates that can be used.&nbsp; 
Indeed, entire hetero groups can be defined as being rigid, but free to move 
within a cavity.&nbsp; In such a case, the first atom in the hetero group would 
be defined in either unconstrained internal or Cartesian coordinates, the next 
atom would be in internal coordinates and have its bond-length fixed, the next 
atom would be internal coordinates and have a frozen bond length and angle, and 
all the remaining atoms in the hetero group would be in internal coordinates and 
have all coordinates frozen.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">In a small molecule, in 
this 
example: toluene, if the molecule is defined in Cartesian coordinates and a C-C bond-length is to be frozen, then a suitable data set would 
be:</font></p>

<p>A GUI is essential for working out the bond-length, angle, and dihedral&nbsp; 
to be used.</p>
<h4 align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">What to when the atoms to be used in 
the connectivity occur after the atom whose bond length or angle is to be locked</font></h4>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">Quite often, the geometry 
does not allow a bond-length or angle to be defined, because the atoms that 
would be used in the connectivity are defined after the atom of interest.&nbsp; 
Fortunately, there is an easy way to solve this problem: the order of occurrence 
of Cartesian atoms is not important, so simply move the atoms to be used in the 
connectivity to before the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined.&nbsp; 
Alternatively, move the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined to the 
end of the data set.</font></p>
<h2 align="left">The <a name="bias_to_ref">overall structure</a> can be biased in favor of a reference 
geometry</h2>
<p align="left">X-ray structures can be improved (!) by combining the accuracy 
of prediction of bond-lengths and angles with the accurate X-ray tertiary 
structure.&nbsp; This is done using the <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF="&lt;text&gt;"</tt>
</a>option.&nbsp; To use this option, first prepare a data-set starting with the 
X-ray structure.&nbsp; Resolve any structural or positional disorder,  add 
hydrogen atoms as necessary, then optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; 
The result would be a data-set representing a chemically sensible structure in 
which all the non-hydrogen atoms are based on the X-ray structure.&nbsp; Copy 
this data set and give the copy a name such as ref.mop.&nbsp; In the original 
data set, add keywords <tt>GEO_REF="/Users/&lt;myname&gt;/ref.mop"</tt> or 
<tt>GEO_REF="M:/&lt;pathname&gt;/ref.mop"</tt>.&nbsp; The default bias 
is 3 kcal/mol/<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;ngstrom.&nbsp; This can be changed 
by adding the bias after the closing quotation mark, as in </font> <tt>GEO_REF="/Users/&lt;myname&gt;/ref.mop"10.</tt></p>
<h2 align="left">An <a name="bias_to_barrier">overall structure</a> can be biased (moved) towards the 
structure on the other side of a barrier.</h2>
<p align="left">Locating transition states has traditionally been difficult.&nbsp; 
However, if data sets representing the reactants and products are available, the <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF="&lt;text&gt;"</tt>
</a>option can be used for moving the reactant geometry towards that of the 
product, and <i>vice-versa</i>. Let the reactant geometry be R.mop and the 
product geometry be P.mop.&nbsp; The product geometry can be moved in the 
direction of the reactant geometry by adding the keyword&nbsp; <tt>GEO_REF="/Users/&lt;myname&gt;/R.mop"</tt> 
to the product geometry data set.&nbsp; When that constrained optimization is 
run, the result is a geometry that is nearer to the reactant geometry than the 
starting geometry. If the constraint were subsequently removed, and the geometry 
re-optimized, the geometry would slide back downhill in the direction of the 
original product geometry.&nbsp; For more information on locating transition 
states, see <a href="Protein_calculations.html">protein calculations</a>.</p>
