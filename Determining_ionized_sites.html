<h1>Determining Ionized Sites in a Protein</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Having a very good starting model before starting any investigation of 
protein chemistry is essential.&nbsp; The starting model should be solvated, as 
many faults as possible should be corrected, all the parts needed should be 
present - the protein, the substrate, any water or other small molecules, etc., 
and the amount of ionization should be correct.&nbsp; This last requirement 
depends on the chemistry of the protein, on the pH of the solvent, and on other 
factors.&nbsp; Because of these factors, the problem of determining which sites 
are ionized might seem very hard to solve.&nbsp; In practice, however, the 
process of determining which sites are ionized is really quite straightforward.</p>
<p>By default, when hydrogen atoms are added to a PDB file or other data set, 
all valencies are satisfied by the addition of hydrogen atoms, i.e., no charged 
sites are generated.&nbsp; This option was deliberately chosen so that an 
unambiguous starting structure would be produced as a starting point for further 
manipulations.&nbsp; Of course, charged sites exist in real proteins, and the 
objective at this point is to selectively ionize sites in a protein in order to 
generate a more realistic model.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Intrinsic ionized sites</h2>
<p>Although obvious, it bears repeating: know as much as possible about the 
system being studied, in particular about the ionized sites in it. If there is 
an ionized site, then add or remove hydrogen atoms as needed in order to have 
the correct ionization.&nbsp; This can be done using a GUI, or by using keyword
<a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a>.</p>
<h2>Salt bridges</h2>
<p>When the positions of the hydrogen atoms are optimized some 
<a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a> might form spontaneously, but in many cases there is a barrier to proton 
migration and a salt bridge that should exist does not in fact form.&nbsp; The 
easiest way to make a specific salt bridge is to use <tt>SITE</tt> to ionize 
both residues that form the salt bridge.&nbsp; Quite often it is not easy to 
know if a salt bridge should exist, however there is an easy test to answer this 
question.&nbsp; If a salt bridge lowers the heat of formation, then the salt 
bridge should exist, and <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; To test whether a salt 
bridge lowers the heat of formation, run two geometry optimization jobs - one 
with the salt bridge and one without the salt bridge.&nbsp; 
Of course, in order to allow heats of formation to be compared, the set of 
keywords used should be the same, in particular if <a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a> 
is used in&nbsp;one job it should be used in the other.</p>
