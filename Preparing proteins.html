<h1 align="center">Preparing protein data sets </h1>
<h2>Protein specific features</h2>
<p>Constructing data-sets for polypeptides, proteins and protein-like molecules 
is difficult.&nbsp; Most of the sources of protein structures, such as the
<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do" target="_parent">Protein Data Bank</a>, do not include 
hydrogen atoms, or, if they are present, there are errors in where they are put.&nbsp; 
These errors usually result in sites being ionized when they should be neutral, 
and <i>vice versa</i>.&nbsp; MOPAC contains a utility for adding hydrogen atoms 
to protein and other organic structures.&nbsp; The default is to make all 
organic sites neutral, so readily ionizable residues, such as Lys,&nbsp; Arg, 
Asp and Glu are, by default, neutral.&nbsp; Several utilities are provided in 
MOPAC that help with constructing data-sets.&nbsp; Running these utilities uses 
very little CPU time.</p>
<h2>Steps involved in preparing a protein data set for use in modeling protein 
behavior</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Using the information in the &lt;file&gt;.log file, edit the &lt;file&gt;.arc 
structure to make any necessary corrections.&nbsp; If no log file exists then 
skip this step.&nbsp; Make only the absolute minimum edits necessary, i.e., 
limit edits to the addition or deletion of atoms, but, unless essential, don't 
move atoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">If atoms must be moved, edit the file &lt;file_from_pdb&gt;.pdb and save 
the edited file as &lt;file&gt;.mop, then re-run that file, in other words, 
start from the beginning again.&nbsp; This avoids having 
to move hydrogen atoms, a procedure that is prone to human errors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Save the edited file as &lt;file_opt-H&gt;.mop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, <a href="Optimizing_hydrogen_atoms.html">optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms</a> 
while holding the positions of all the other atoms fixed, then check the
<a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a> and other features.&nbsp; If any 
changes are made, re-run the partial optimization to relieve stresses once more.&nbsp; 
The resulting structure will then be a good starting point for subsequent 
operations.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">(Optional) Resequencing the atoms to make all atoms in a residue 
contiguous</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When hydrogen atoms are added, they are put at the end of the 
data-set and PDB file.&nbsp; This allows a simple comparison to be made between 
the raw PDB file and the hydrogenated form.&nbsp; For all subsequent work with 
proteins,&nbsp; it might be easier to have all atoms in each residue together.&nbsp; 
This can be achieved by resequencing the data set, using <a href="reseq.html"><tt>
RESEQ</tt></a>.&nbsp; At present, the advantages or disadvantages of doing this are 
not obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation is fast and easy to carry out, so give it 
a try?</p>
