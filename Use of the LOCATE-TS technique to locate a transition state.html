Use of the LOCATE-TS technique to locate a transition state</h1>
<p class="auto-style5">
LOCATE-TS is ideally suited for finding transition states in enzyme mechanisms.&nbsp; 
Instead of several worked examples involving different enzymes, the examples 
here all refer to different steps in the chymotrypsin catalyzed hydrolysis of a 
peptide bond.&nbsp; For a detailed description see the
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00894-017-3326-8">published 
article</a>. To reproduce the chymotrypsin mechanism, see the
<a href="J_Mol_Mod_(2017)_files_Chymotrypsin_catalytic_mechanism/Supplementary_Material.html">
supplementary materials</a></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
General notes</p>
<p class="auto-style5">
A good starting model is essential for investigating enzyme mechanisms. This 
model should represent the first step in the catalytic cycle.&nbsp; Check it 
carefully to ensure that it is as perfect as possible - if a change has to be 
made later on, it might require all previous steps to be changed and re-run.&nbsp; 
Although this is not very time-consuming, it is annoying, and can usually be 
avoided by having a better starting model.</p>
<p class="auto-style5">
Make intermediates by moving atoms around using a GUI.&nbsp; If necessary, the 
sequence of the atoms can be changed, but do not change the part of the PDB atom 
label that identifies the atom.&nbsp; For example, if the MOPAC data-set line 
for an atom consists of: <strong>"C(ATOM 36 CA PRO E 4) 8.35040525 +1 
13.76512201 +1 27.02235000 +1"</strong> the part that should not be changed is
<strong>"CA PRO E 4</strong>".&nbsp; Within a catalytic cycle, an atom might 
change from being covalently bonded to one specific atom to being covalently 
bonded to another atom, that is, it is involved in a chemical reaction.&nbsp; 
Although the atom is now in a different environment, its PDB label must not be 
changed. This means that, at the end of the cycle, some atoms will appear to 
have the wrong labels.&nbsp; This is expected and is necessary. An incidental 
benefit of this requirement is that the path of an atom through the catalytic 
cycle can easily be followed.&nbsp; If there is a need to update the atom 
labels, use keyword RESIDUES, but if tat is done, the resulting structure should 
not be used in any runs involving keywords LOCATE-TS, SADDLE or COMPARE.</p>
<p class="auto-style5">
From the "distance" between adjacent intermediates it might appear that they 
have very different geometries.&nbsp; This is a common phenomenon, caused by the 
large motion of the enzyme as it settles into the energy minimum for the 
intermediate.&nbsp; That this large "distance" is not important can easily be 
demonstrated by using LOCATE-TS=(C:5,5;), this moves both systems to near the 
bottom of the reaction barrier, to the point where the slope amounts to 5 
kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> .&Aring;<sup>-1</sup>. At that point, the "distance" 
should be much smaller than it was.</p>
<p class="auto-style5">
There is an increased chance of user-error in preparing LOCATE-TS jobs, so the 
addition of keywords that trap errors is worthwhile.&nbsp; Always add keyword
<a href="charge.html"><tt>CHARGE=<em>n</em></tt></a>, even when the system has a net 
charge of zero.&nbsp; Of course, check that the value of "<em>n</em>" is correct 
before starting a LOCATE-TS job! Do not use <a href="geo-ok.html"><tt>GEO-OK</tt></a> or
<a href="let.html"><tt>LET</tt></a> unless necessary - these keywords are intended to 
trap errors in data.</p>
