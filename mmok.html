<tt>MMOK</tt> </h1>
<p>Recently, July 2013, a Molecular Mechanics correction was added to RM1, PM6, and 
PM7.&nbsp; MM corrections have been available for MNDO, AM1, and PM3 for a long 
time.&nbsp; Because of the recent change to RM1, PM6, and PM7, keyword <tt>MMOK</tt> must 
be used if the molecular mechanics correction is wanted.&nbsp; <tt>MMOK</tt> is only 
needed if peptide bonds are present. Eventually <tt>MMOK</tt> will become 
the default, and the keyword will become redundant.</p>
<p>If the molecular mechanics correction is not wanted, then <a href="nomm.html">
<tt>NOMM</tt></a> should be used. </p>
<p>If the system contains a peptide linkage, then when a molecular mechanics correction 
is made the barrier to rotation about the peptide bond is increased (to 14.00 kcal/mol in N-methyl acetamide). </p>
<p class="auto-style3">The peptide linkage consists of the group -CO-NH-.&nbsp; 
In 
most instances the O=C-N-H torsion or dihedral angle is near to 180&deg; and in a 
few instances the angle is roughly 0&deg;, in other words, most peptide bonds 
are 
more-or-less flat.&nbsp; In proteins, because of environmental effects, the 
deviation of the angle from these ideal angles can be greater.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
most important deviations from planarity occur when a peptide bond changes from cis to trans or vice versa.&nbsp; During such reactions the torsion angle goes 
through 90&deg;.&nbsp; In the case of N-methyl-acetamide, the barrier to 
rotation has been calculated, using highly accurate ab-initio methods, to be 
about 14 kcal/mol.&nbsp; Semiempirical methods predict a smaller barrier.&nbsp; 
To correct this fault, a small molecular mechanics correction is added to the 
calculated heat of formation; this correction has the form:</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub>' =
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> +c.sin(&theta;)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="auto-style3">where c is a constant depending on the semiempirical 
method, and <font face="symbol">f</font> is the O=C-N-H torsion angle.&nbsp; 
Obviously, if the torsion angle is 180&deg; or 0&deg;, i.e., the default peptide bond 
angle, then no correction will be made, but for all other angles there is an 
energy penalty that biases the peptide bond towards planarity.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">In practice, this MM correction to the peptide bond 
produces an insignificant bias towards planarity in proteins, because most 
peptide bonds in proteins are almost planar anyhow, and a significant change in 
barrier heights when reactions involving twisting a peptide bond are modeled.</p>
