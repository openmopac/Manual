<h1>Comparing two proteins</h1>
<p>Any two proteins can be compared using a utility within MOPAC.&nbsp; The 
general form of the data set that allows two proteins to be compared consists of 
two or three lines: keywords, title, and if wanted a comment line. A minimum set 
of keywords would consist of <a href="geo_dat.html"><tt>
GEO_DAT</tt></a>, <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a>, <tt>and
<a href="compare.html">COMPARE</a></tt>. 
A useful keyword to add is <a href="output.html"><tt>OUTPUT</tt></a>; this reduces the 
size of the results, and allows the important material to be found more easily.&nbsp; 
The results of a 
comparison consist of a standard output file that gives a detailed description 
of the relationship between the two proteins, their similarities and their 
differences, a HTML web-page, a PDB file for each of the two proteins, and other 
less-important files.&nbsp; Individual differences can be easily seen by opening 
the JSmol HTML web-page and using the options provided.</p>
<p>Some differences in the two systems can be tolerated, for example one system 
might have residues missing that are present in the other system, or it might 
have a different ligand non-covalently bonded to a site.&nbsp; Provided the 
atoms common to both systems have the same PDB name (atom numbers are ignored), 
they will be included in the comparison.</p>
<p>Several types of comparison can 
be done, among these are:</p>
<h3>Comparing two steps in a reaction mechanism or two different optimizations</h3>
<p>Systems of this type are easy to compare, they have the same atoms, charge, 
and PDB atom labels.&nbsp; An example of such a data-set is:</p>
<pre> compare output noreor ++ 
  geo_dat="../All - new gradients, no PRECISE/23H 30-3.arc" ++
  geo_ref="../All - new gradients, PRECISE/23H 30-3.arc" 
 Comparison of the effect of using keyword "PRECISE" and not using it.</pre>
Keyword "<a href="noreor.html"><tt>NOREOR</tt></a>" is useful here; it prevents the small changes in orientation that 
are normally 
made when systems are compared.&nbsp; For neatness, the data-set uses the "<a href="plusplus.html">++</a>" 
option to split the keyword line into several lines, in this case three lines.<h3>Comparing two raw PDB files</h3>
<p>Comparison of two closely-related structures can be illustrated using the 
small protein Crambin, for which two high-resolution PDB entries 
exist: 1EJG and 1CBN.&nbsp; These can be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank; 
they have the default names 1EJG.pdb and 1CBN.pdb.&nbsp; Make up a data set, &quot;Compare 1EJG and 1CBN.mop&quot;, that 
contains the two lines:</p><pre><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>=&quot;1EJG.pdb" <a href="geo_ref.html">GEO_REF</a>=&quot;1CBN.pdb" <a href="compare.html">COMPARE</a> <a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a>
Comparison of two PDB structures for Crambin </pre>
<p>If this job is run, the two proteins will be compared. </p>
<h3>Comparing two hydrogenated PDB files</h3>
<p>When two or more PDB entries represent the same system, there is a natural 
strong desire to compare the various structures.&nbsp; A good example is 
provided by the small protein Crambin, for which two high-resolution PDB entries 
exist: 1EJG and 1CBN. After hydrogenation and optimization of the hydrogen atom 
positions, the two resulting ARC files can be compared using the following 
data-set:</p>
<pre> geo_dat="Crambin (1EJG).arc" ++
 geo_ref="Crambin (1CBN).arc" ++
 compare output
 Compare the hydrogenated PDB files for two models of Crambin
 </pre>
<p>Examination of 1EJG and 
1CBN reveals that 1CBN has a hetero-group, C<sub>2</sub>O, this moiety is missing in 
1EJG.&nbsp; From the PDB remarks this entity is identified as ethanol, and 
indeed 
when 1CBN is hydrogenated (<a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt></a>) six 
hydrogen atoms are added to it to form ethanol.&nbsp; Because of this, although 
the heats of formation are present in the ARC files they should be ignored in 
the results of the <tt>COMPARE</tt> job. </p>
