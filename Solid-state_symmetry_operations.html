<h1 class="auto-style1">Solid-state Symmetry Operations</h1>
Solid-state symmetry operations are used in two ways in Program BZ.<br/><br/>
(A)&nbsp;
To symmetrize the energy matrix so that the band-structure is more 
symmetric.&nbsp; If symmetry operations are not performed on a band-structure, 
then small artifacts can appear in band structures.&nbsp; For example, bands of 
different symmetry should be able to cross.&nbsp; If the energy matrix is not 
symmetrized, small errors in symmetry, due to errors in geometry or 
insufficiently tight criteria, can result in small gaps between the bands, 
resulting in the appearance of a non-crossing interaction.<br/><br/>
(B)&nbsp;
To generate the little group for a point in <em>k</em>-space, i.e., symmetry 
theory can be used in analyzing the properties of individual points in the 
Brillouin zone.<h3>Description and construction of<a name="the symmetry-operations file file.ops"> 
the symmetry-operations file &lt;file&gt;.ops</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;Because of the usefulness of symmetry, the 
option exists to read in all the <a href="Solids_space_group_operations.html">space-group operations</a> for the system.&nbsp; 
For a file containing energy band information &lt;file&gt;.brz, the symmetry 
operations would be provided in a file named &lt;file&gt;.ops.&nbsp; If &lt;file&gt;.ops is&nbsp; 
present, these operations will be automatically used in constructing little 
groups and in symmetrizing the band structure.</p>
<p>The order of translation vectors is important. Within BZ,<em> k</em>-space is 
orientated so that the first <em>k</em>-direction is along the "x" axis, the 
second <em>k</em>-direction is in the "xy" plane, and the third <em>k</em>-direction 
is out-of-plane.&nbsp; If the axes are all at 90&deg; to each other, no problems 
arise. If the axes are not all at 90&deg; to each other, then for the symmetry 
operations to work, the order of the axes is important.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, as would 
normally be the case, internal coordinates are used, then the first translation 
direction should be along the unique axis, if one exists.&nbsp; For a worked 
example see graphite. </p>
<p>Symmetry operations are represented by the product of a point-group operation 
and a translation in the crystallographic unit cell. Each symmetry operation is 
defined using 12 data, these are, in order:</p>

		unit cell or half a translation vector <br/>representing motion through 
		one unit cell in the first translation direction.</td>

<td>a.aa b.bb c.cc</td>
<td>The location of the center of the point-group operation, in &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; 
		<br/>In most systems, 
the first atom will be at the origin, i.e., at 
coordinates (0.0,0.0,0.0)&nbsp; <br/>A useful strategy is to make sure that atom 1 is 
at the center of symmetry.&nbsp; <br/>If the center of the point-group operation is 
between atoms, then use the MOPAC <br/>data set, output, or arc file to work out its 
coordinates.<br/><br/><em>IF POSSIBLE, AVOID USING NON-ZERO VALUES.&nbsp; USE 
		NON-TRIVIAL TRANSLATIONS INSTEAD.<br/>ONLY USE NON-ZERO VALUES FOR 
		POLYMERS. </em></td>
