<h2><a name="Description">Description</a></h2>
<p>When <tt>COMPARE </tt>is present, a pair of protein systems is compared to identify similarities and 
differences in their geometries. These systems can be PDB or ENT files, MOPAC 
data sets, i.e., files that end in ".mop" or ".dat", or MOPAC archive files, 
i.e., files that end in ".arc". The comparison is done using a MOPAC data-set 
that contains information on the locations of the systems to be used.&nbsp; A 
useful practice is to have the systems in one or two folders and the data-set 
for the comparison in another folder at the same level, e.g., if the systems are 
in "Users/name/Crambin/Original PDB files" and "Users/name/Crambin/MOPAC files" 
then the compare files should be in "/Users/name/Crambin/Compare"</p>
<p>In a normal run, atoms of one system are re-arranged to match those of the 
other 
system,&nbsp;so that both systems have the same atoms in the same sequence. The 
geometry of one system, "System A", is then rotated and translated to minimize the difference 
between it and that of "System B." Once the systems are in maximum coincidence, 
an analysis is performed; this identifies differences in the systems, 
differences in bond-lengths, and other quantities, such as the Root-Mean-Square 
and average atomic position differences.</p>
<p>In the PDB format there are two systems for labeling hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; 
MOPAC uses the older system.&nbsp; If one file uses the new system and the other uses 
the old system, the file that uses the new system can be converted into the old 
one by keyword <tt> <a href="site.html">SITE=()</a>.</tt></p>
<p>If <a href="let.html"><tt>LET</tt></a> is present, then hydrogen atoms that 
are equivalent in the two systems, but have different names, will be treated as 
if they were equivalent.&nbsp; Normally, these atoms would be excluded from the 
analysis, but it's useful to include them when different steps in a reaction 
mechanism are being compared. This is particularly useful when hydrogen atoms 
(protons or hydride ions) migrate from one atom to another, for example when a 
hydroxyl group ionizes.</p>

<h3><a name="General">General</a></h3>
<p>The recommended way to use <tt>COMPARE </tt>is to use a data set, e.g. 
"compare the geometries of system-A and system-B.mop", that 
contains three lines of the type:
</p><pre>COMPARE geo_dat="System A" geo_ref="System B" output
Text to be displayed
Second line of text to be displayed (Optional)</pre>
In this

form, with <a href="output.html"><tt><strong>OUTPUT</strong></tt></a> present, the 
amount of output is minimized and only data related to the comparison is 
printed.&nbsp; A web-page in <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>, e.g., "compare the 
geometries of system-A and system-B.html", is written that allows a very rapid 
visual comparison of features.

<h3><a name="Systems">Systems</a></h3>
<p>The text "System A" and "System B" should be replaced with the file-names for 
the systems of interest. For example, to compare a protein system "1A1A PDB structure.mop" and 
"1A1A optimized.arc" the first line would consist of:</p><pre>COMPARE geo_dat="1A1A optimized.arc" geo_ref="1A1A PDB structure.mop" output
Compare original PDB structure and optimized geometry for system 1A1A </pre>

swapped in the <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a> data-set if that would

To prevent this swapping, add <tt>NOSWAP</tt>.</p>
<p><tt><a href="noreor.html">NOREOR</a>:</tt> Do not move the <tt>GEO_REF</tt>

<p>Optional, but useful.&nbsp; These lines will be displayed in the HTML web-page, 
and an informative description of the system can be very helpful later on when 
several web-pages are being used. </p>
<h2><a name="Analysis">Analysis</a></h2>
<p>"<strong>Differences in atoms sets</strong>" - Self-explanatory.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Have a quick look at the differences, and if nothing unexplained is seen, ignore 
this section.</p>
<p>"<strong>Number of atoms</strong>" - Self-explanatory.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"<strong>After docking - Atoms that move a lot</strong>" - This list is in 
order of decreasing motion.&nbsp; The first entry is the atom that shows the 
largest motion in going from one system to the other.&nbsp; A useful operation 
would be to open the HTML web-page generated by the run, and look at some of the 
atoms that move a lot.</p>
<p><b>"Residues that move a lot and their (Movement in Angstroms per atom)" - </b>
This list is in order of decreasing motion.&nbsp; The first entry is the residue 
that shows the largest motion in going from one system to the other. </p>
<p>In the next few entries, the assumption is made that one geometry is a 
reference, e.g., a PDB file downloaded from the internet, and the other is a 
geometry optimized using MOPAC.</p>
<p>"<strong>Difference between GEO_DAT and GEO_REF:</strong>" <br/>&nbsp;"total" 
is the sum of the differences in atom positions.<br/>&nbsp;"Average" is "total" 
divided by the number of atoms.<br/>&nbsp;"RMS, in Angstroms" is the 
root-mean-square of the differences between the two geometries.&nbsp; This is strictly comparable with the RMSD quantities reported 
in other fields of protein structural chemistry, e.g., different PDB reports on 
the same system.</p>
<p>In the HTML file, "Diff." is the same as the "total" in the output file, and 
"RMSD" is the same as "RMS" in the output file.</p>
<p>"<strong>Differences between bond-lengths for the two geometries</strong>" 
- This is important.&nbsp; There are three common reasons for large (greater 
than 0.05 or 4%) differences in bond-length: (A) faults in the PDB structure, 
(B) faults in the computational method being used, e.g., PM7 with COSMO, and (C) 
incorrect hydrogenation resulting in a local fault in the chemical structure.&nbsp; 
To identify where the fault lies, examine the bond using the HTML web-page.&nbsp; 
In order to get a better view of the fault, display only the local environment 
of the two atoms. If the fault is identified as (A), ignore the fault - it was 
corrected by the geometry optimization.&nbsp; If (B), also ignore the fault, but 
make a note that this is a fault in the method being used, and might be 
important.&nbsp; If you think it is important, try using a different method, 
e.g., PM6-D3H4 with COSMO.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most PDB structures do not include hydrogen atoms, and do not distinguish 
between the carboxylic acid C-O distances or between arginine CZ and (NH1 or 
NH2) distances. When a geometry is optimized, pairs of C-O and C-N bonds that 
PDB reports are the same length will be predicted to have distinctly different 
lengths, one will be a single bond and the other a double bond. This causes a 
difference in bond-lengths to be reported, but these differences are not a 
result of a fault in either the PDB or the semiempirical structure.&nbsp; 
Instead, these differences should be ignored. For example, the following Table 
lists the pairs of atoms that show the largest differences in bond-lengths.&nbsp; 
All the atom-pairs that involve carboxylate atoms, e.g. GLU CD and (OE1 or OE2), 
ASP CG and (OD1 or OD2) or guanidine atoms in ARG&nbsp; CZ and (NH1 or NH2) 
should be ignored.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both PM6 and PM7 over-estimate the peptide C-N bond-length by about 0.08 &Aring;, 
at about 1.37 instead of the expected 1.29 &Aring;.</p>

This is a typical set of differences; every one of them falls into one 
or other of the types described above.<p><u><b>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></u> If the 
fault is caused by incorrect hydrogenation, than edit the optimized geometry 
to correct the fault, and re-run the geometry optimization.&nbsp; Then re-run 
the comparison to verify that the fault has been corrected. Incorrect 
hydrogenation most often occurs in substrates and hetero-groups such as heme 
rings. A lot of grief can be avoided by looking at differences in bond-lengths 
and checking for hydrogenation errors. For examples of PDB files that have 
severe errors in bond-lengths, see <a href="Preparing_a_Starting_data_set.html">Preparing a starting data set</a>.
</p><p>Other global data such as the date, heats of formation,&nbsp;number of atoms, 
etc., are printed in the output and in the HTML web-page.</p>
