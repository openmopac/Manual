<tt>IRC=<i>n</i></tt> </a>
</h1>
An <a href="DRC_coordinates.html">Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate</a> calculation to be run.&nbsp; The following
options are provided:<p>IRC=1 and IRC=1*</p>
<p>This option is intended for use with a transition state. The path from the
transition state to either the reactants or the products is generated. The path
generated depends on the coefficients of the eigenvectors of the normal mode.&nbsp;
There is no easy <em>a priori</em> way of determining what the phase of these
coefficients is, so try running <tt>
IRC</tt>=1, and see if it goes the correct way.&nbsp; If not, use <tt>
IRC</tt>=-1. If <tt>
IRC</tt>=1* or <tt>
IRC</tt>=-1* is used, then the entire <a href="DRC_IRC_Description.html">reaction path</a>, from reactants
or products, through the transition
state, to products or reactants, is mapped.&nbsp; If DRC is present, then the system is given
an initial perturbation in the positive normal coordinate, then the DRC, i.e., 
the total energy conserved path, is
calculated.&nbsp; A simple graph will be made if
	<a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> is added.</p>
<p>These two options require the normal mode for the reaction.&nbsp; A
<a href="force.html"><tt>FORCE</tt></a> or <a href="force.html"><tt>FORCETS</tt></a> calculation must be run in order to generate the normal mode.&nbsp; As 
this is computationally expensive, a useful strategy is to run the <tt>FORCE</tt> or <tt>FORCETS</tt> calculation 
and use <a href="isotope.html"><tt>ISOTOPE</tt></a> to save the results.&nbsp; Then the IRC calculation can be run 
using, e.g., <tt>IRC=1</tt> <tt><a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></tt>.&nbsp; If <tt>RESTART </tt>is not present, a FORCE calculation 
will automatically be run first.</p>
<p>IRC=+<i>n </i>or IRC=<i>n</i></p>
<p>Normally used with <a href="drc0.html"><tt>DRC</tt></a>, this option perturbs the system along the <i>n</i>'th
normal mode.&nbsp; One quantum of kinetic energy is added, the value of the
quantum being that of the associated vibrational energy.&nbsp; This option
allows the exact normal mode to be mapped out.&nbsp; IRC=n with DRC can be used
with both ground and transition state systems.&nbsp; If IRC=1 and DRC is used
with transition states, it would map out the dynamic path from the transition
state to reactants or products. </p>
<p>IRC=-n</p>
<p>The same as IRC=+<i>n</i>, except the initial perturbation is in the opposite
direction. Except for transition states, this option can be duplicated by one of
the other options described here.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to keep some atoms fixed, atoms in the data-set that are 
not flagged for optimization can be frozen by adding keyword <tt>
<a href="nooptx.html">NOOPT</a></TT>.</p>
<p>When studying reaction paths involving transition states, one option, although implied logically from the above description of the IRC,
should not be used.&nbsp; The option IRC=<i>n</i>, where&nbsp; <i>n</i> is not
equal to 1 or -1, is meaningless.&nbsp; To see why, consider the option IRC=1.&nbsp;
That maps the reaction path, and uses the lowest transition state normal mode,
i.e. the mode with the imaginary frequency.&nbsp; Any other mode would simply
return to the transition state, in other words, it would do nothing useful.</p>
<p>By default, all steps that are calculated are printed.&nbsp; To produce a more 
meaningful graph, use keyword <a href="x-priority.html"><tt>X-PRIORITY</tt></a>.</p>
