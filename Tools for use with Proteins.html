<h2><a name="Adding_hydrogen_atoms">Adding hydrogen atoms</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<p class="auto-style6">Most PDB files do not include hydrogen atoms, so these 
need to be added before any serious calculations are done.&nbsp; The simplest 
way to add hydrogen atoms is to run the un-modified PDB file using MOPAC.&nbsp; 
This will produce a fully-hydrogenated system, with all ionizable sites 
neutralized.&nbsp; As this is normally not suitable for modeling because some 
sites should be ionized, an alternative and better 
hydrogenation strategy is to make a MOPAC data-set that uses the PDB file.</p>
<h3>Adding hydrogen atoms using a MOPAC data-set (recommended procedure)</h3>
<p class="auto-style7">To hydrogenate a PDB file, create a MOPAC data-set that has an 
informative name, for example, if the PDB file is 5A5A.pdb, then name the MOPAC 
data-set "5A5A Add-H.mop"&nbsp;&nbsp;This file should contain the 
following lines:</p>
<pre><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>="5A5A.pdb" <a href="add-h.html">ADD-H</a> <a href="site.html">SITE</a>=(SALT) <a href="html.html">HTML</a> <a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a> <a href="nocomments.html"><tt>NOCOMMENTS</tt></a>
Adding hydrogen atoms to 5A5A</pre>
<p class="auto-style7">By using <tt>GEO_DAT</tt> the PDB file can be 
left unmodified. Having the PDB file in a different folder reduces the 
possibility of altering it.&nbsp; If that is done, 
edit the <tt>GEO_DAT </tt>keyword to suit, for example <tt>GEO_DAT="../../original 
PDB files/5A5A.pdb"</tt>.&nbsp;<br/><tt>ADD-H</tt> is the command to hydrogenate the 
entire system and neutralize all ionizable sites.<br/><tt>SITE=(SALT)</tt> This will 
form <a href="salt_bridges.html">salt-bridges</a>, ionized pairs of amino-acid 
residues that are near each other.<br/><tt>HTML </tt>At the start of a 
project, a simple and rapid way is needed for checking various parts of the 
protein system.&nbsp; The fastest way, see <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>, is to use Firefox and the JSmol program.<br/>
<tt>OUTPUT </tt> At this stage the focus is on hydrogenation and on any problems 
associated with the original PDB file, so suppressing the geometry in the output 
file allows details of the hydrogenation to be seen more easily.<br/>
<tt>NOCOMMENTS</tt> This will suppress the PDB comments, remarks, etc.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Run the 
hydrogenation job, e.g., MOPAC2016.exe "5A5A Add-H.mop"<br/><br/>Look at the 
output and at the JSmol HTML file.&nbsp; In the output, look to see if there are 
any messages that might cause concern, such as "Residues where the number of 
hydrogen atoms is not equal to that expected" If any such messages appear, 
carefully look at the site(s) mentioned.&nbsp; If the cause of the report is 
found, take the appropriate action.&nbsp; Most often the cause will be a severe 
error in the original PDB file.</p>
<p class="auto-style7">Check the hydrogenation of hetero groups, particularly 
porphyrin and heme heterocycles, and systems where there are more than one valid 
Lewis structure, such as guanine.&nbsp; If the system has known charged sites or 
if there are sites that should be ionized, and they're currently not charged, or 
if a hydrogen atom is missing that should be present, 
or a hydrogen atom is present and it's not wanted, then edit the hydrogenation 
data-set, e.g., edit "5A5A Add-H.mop" to correct the error, then save the 
edited file and re-run the hydrogenation. If other errors are found, make the 
appropriate changes to the hydrogenation data set and re-run it.&nbsp; By 
editing the hydrogenation data-set, a complete record of all the corrections 
that were made would be generated. </p>
<p class="auto-style7" dir="ltr">The next step involves transitioning from the 
simple hydrogenation to a more realistic and useful data-set.&nbsp; To do this, 
edit the ARC file to make a new data-set.&nbsp; Making sure that the various 
sites in the protein are correctly ionized is essential, so add
<a href="charges.html"><tt>CHARGES</tt></a>, this will print out all the charged sites 
found in the system along with the net charge on the protein. If there there are faults in the charges, 
correct them by using <tt>SITE</tt> to add or delete hydrogen atoms as 
appropriate in the previous step, and in complicated cases, particularly heme, by using 
<a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> and <a href="setpi.html"><tt>SETPI</tt></a> to ensure that the 
Lewis structure is correct.</p>
<p class="auto-style7">All that remains is to optimize the positions of the 
hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; To do this, copy the ARC file for the hydrogenated system 
and name the copy, e.g., "5A5A Opt-H.mop".&nbsp; Edit this file to make a 
data set.&nbsp; Use keywords:</p>
<p class="auto-style7">&nbsp;<tt><a href="charge.html">CHARGE=n</a> HTML OUTPUT 
<a href="eps.html">EPS=78.4</a> <a href="nooptx.html">NOOPT</a>
<a href="opth.html">OPT-H</a> <a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a>
<a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=5</a></tt></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Set the charge to suit the system.&nbsp; If the supplied 
and calculated charges are different, examine the list of calculated ionized 
sites to find what caused the difference, then take the appropriate action.<br/>Use <tt>EPS=78.4</tt> in all protein work, it mimics implicit water as the solvent.<br/><tt>NOOPT</tt> and <tt>OPT-H</tt> 
together specify that only the positions of the hydrogen atoms 
are to be optimized.<br/><tt>MOZYME</tt> - essential.<br/><tt>GNORM=5</tt> (or for large systems, 
over ~5000 atoms, <tt>GNORM=10</tt>) High precision of geometry optimization is not 
essential here.</p>
<p class="auto-style7">Run this job.&nbsp; It will take from an hour to about 
two days, depending on the size of the system.&nbsp; A useful user-pacifier at 
this point is to use the Linux "tail" utility, as in:</p>
<p class="auto-style7">tail -100f "5A5A Opt-H.out"</p>
<p class="auto-style7">When the job finishes, have a look at the results.&nbsp; 
Most likely there will not be anything very interesting.&nbsp; If there are 
error message, examine them and take the appropriate action.</p>
<h2><a name="Finding_and_correcting_faults_in_the_PDB_file">Finding and 
correcting faults in the PDB file</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<h3>Common features of PDB files that cause problems (<a href="ADD-H%20Proteins.html">Worked 
examples</a>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Severely incorrect bond-lengths.&nbsp; Bond-lengths are used in 
	assigning hydrogen atoms to heterogroups.&nbsp; For example, a C<sub>2</sub>F 
	structure could be any one of the three molecules H-C&equiv;C-F, H2C=CHF, or 
	H<sub>3</sub>C-CH<sub>2</sub>F. The C-C distance is used in deciding which 
	of these molecule to make.&nbsp; If the C-C distance is severely incorrect, then 
	the wrong hydrogenation will be used. </li>
<li>An atom might be in a completely wrong position.&nbsp; An example is 
	when two nitrogen atoms in the guanidine group in arginine are within 0.2 &Aring;ngstroms 
	of each other.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Frequently, when a molecule has a finite (typically 50%) probability of 
	being in two different positions, both positions will be reported along with 
	the probability.&nbsp; This is not an error in the PDB structure, but severe 
	problems can occur if both molecules are used in making the starting model.&nbsp; 
	The commonest example is when a water molecule can be in two positions 
	separated by about one &Aring;ngstrom. This would be represented in the PDB 
	structure as an O<sub>2</sub> molecule, and hydrogenation would produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; 
    See also <a href="alt_a.html"><tt>ALT_A</tt></a> for handling structural disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a reason to suspect that there are errors in the PDB file a test 
to identify geometric errors can be run.&nbsp; But don't do this test unless 
there is a good reason. This requires 
running a single SCF calculation and calculating the gradients (forces) acting on 
all the non-hydrogen atoms. For this, start with the ARC file from the 
<a href="#Adding_hydrogen_atoms">hydrogenation operation</a>.&nbsp; Use the ARC file in which the positions of the hydrogen 
atoms have been optimized.&nbsp; Edit this file to make a data-set named, e.g., 
"5A5A Opt-H 1SCF.mop"&nbsp; Use keywords:</p>
<p class="auto-style7">&nbsp;<tt><a href="charge.html">CHARGE=n</a>
<a href="html.html">HTML</a> <a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a> <a href="eps.html">
EPS=78.4</a> <a href="invert.html">INVERT</a>
<a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a> <a href="gradients.html">GRADIENTS</a>
<a href="one_scf.html">1SCF</a></tt></p>
<p class="auto-style7"> <tt>INVERT </tt>reverses all the optimization flags, so the 
hydrogen atoms optimization flags are set "off" and the optimization flags for 
all other atoms are set "on."</p>
<p class="auto-style7">Run this job, and look at the section in the output 
headed "LARGEST ATOMIC GRADIENTS"&nbsp; Large gradients indicate a large 
difference between the calculated local environment of an atom and the local 
environment in the PDB file.&nbsp; Most PDB files do not distinguish the C-OH 
and C=O bond-lengths in a carboxylate, -COOH, group, but semiempirical methods 
predict a significant difference, typically the C-OH bond-length is ~1.31 &Aring;ngstroms 
and the C=O bond-length is 1.23  &Aring;ngstroms. Because of this, gradients on 
carboxylate carbon and oxygen atoms are often in the range 100 - 200 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>.&amp;Aring<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; 
These can be ignored, unless they are over 200 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>.&amp;Aring:<sup>-1</sup>. </p>
<p class="auto-style7">Bond-lengths for sulfate and phosphate are not well 
reproduced, errors of up to 0.1 &Aring; are not uncommon. </p>
<p class="auto-style7">Look for any remaining large gradients, those in the 
range 150 - 200 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>.&Aring;<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp; If any exist, 
look at their local environment using JSmol. In particular, if the atom is in a heterogroup or in a modified residue, check the hydrogenation carefully.&nbsp; 
Most hydrogenation errors can be found by this test.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Check residue names</h3>
<p>In some proteins fragments of residues might be missing, for example a 
threonine residue might have the methyl group missing.&nbsp; Residues of this 
type can be detected by using keyword <a href="residues.html"><tt>RESIDUES</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
Again, only correct errors of this type if they are considered to be important.</p>
<h2><a name="Resequencing">Resequencing</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<p>Resequencing puts all atoms into the standard PDB order, i.e., within 
		each residue the first atom is the nitrogen, this is followed by the 
		rest of the non-hydrogen atoms, then the hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When hydrogen atoms are added or deleted using the SITE keyword, 
		resequencing is done automatically.&nbsp; To prevent this happening, add 
		<tt><a href="noreseq.html">NORESEQ</a></tt>.</p>
<h2><a name="Comparing_two_geometries">Comparing two geometries</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<p>Two protein systems can be compared to see how similar they are.&nbsp; 
		Examples of pairs of systems that can be compared are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hydrogenated PDB X-ray structure and the fully-optimized PM7 
			geometry.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Two stable intermediates in an enzyme catalytic mechanism.</li>
<li>A transition state and the reactants or products in an enzyme 
			catalytic mechanism.</li>
<li>Two different PDB X-ray structures for the same protein or the 
			equivalent fully-optimized PM7 geometries, etc.</li>
<li>A PDB X-ray structure and the equivalent fully-optimized PM7 
			geometry.</li>
<li>Two PDB X-ray structures for closely-related proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the <a href="compare.html">COMPARE</a> operation does not 
		need Firefox and JSmol, using them to examine details of the comparison 
		is extremely helpful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When two systems have different compositions, atoms that present in 
		one structure but not in the other will be deleted.&nbsp; Atoms that are 
		present in both structures, but have slightly different PDB labels, for 
		example a C<sub>&delta;1</sub> in one 
		structure might be a C<sub>&delta;2</sub> in 
		the other, will be used in the comparison.&nbsp; Only the labels in the 
		data structure will be changed; the labels in the reference structure 
		will not be changed.</p>
<h2><a name="Freezing_an_interatomic_distance_">Freezing an interatomic 
		distance</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<p>Proteins are normally defined using Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; 
		Internal coordinates are essential if an interatomic distance, angle, or 
		dihedral is to be frozen.&nbsp; To do this, mixed coordinates are 
		needed.&nbsp; All atoms, except the atom to be frozen, should be defined 
		in Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; The atom to be frozen should be defined 
		in internal coordinates, then the optimization flag for the specific 
		coordinate set to zero.</p>
<p>If the connectivity is entirely numeric, then the frozen atom can 
		have a connectivity that refers to one, two, or three atoms that have 
		not yet been defined.&nbsp; <br/>If the connectivity uses atom labels, 
		the atoms used in the connectivity must already be defined.</p>
<h2><a name="Atom_numbers_and_labels">Atom numbers and labels</a> (<a href="#Tools_in_MOPAC_for_use_with_Proteins">top</a>)</h2>
<p>Atoms can be defined by their atom numbers.&nbsp; This option is not 
		recommended, because the atom numbers might change if atoms are added or deleted.&nbsp; Instead, atom labels are recommended.&nbsp; Two 
		types - PDB labels and JSmol labels - are supported.&nbsp; <br/>If an 
		atom has the PDB label "ATOM 1112 CZ ARG A 423", then the atom label 
		would be "CZ ARG A 423". <br/>If an atom has the JSmol label 
		"[LEU]149:A.CD2", then the atom label would be "[LEU]149:A.CD2". <br/>In 
		the limit, a connectivity for an atom could use all three types of 
		label: number, PDB, and JSmol.</p>
