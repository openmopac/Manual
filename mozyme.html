<h2 align="center">MOZYME</h2></tt>
<p>The keyword <tt>MOZYME</tt> replaces the standard SCF procedure with a 
localized molecular orbital (LMO) method.&nbsp; MOZYME was developed to allow 
very large organic compounds, specifically enzymes, to be easily calculated. The 
time required for a SCF calculation increases approximately linearly with the 
size of the system, see <a href="MOZYME_literature.html">literature on MOZYME</a> 
and <a href="Modeling_proteins.html">Modeling proteins</a>.&nbsp; MOZYME jobs do 
not run faster when a GPU chip is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notes, warnings and cautions concerning MOZYME calculations</h3>
<p>Although a job that uses the MOZYME technique should give results that are 
the same as conventional SCF calculations, in practice there are differences.&nbsp; 
Most of these differences are small, but in some jobs the differences between 
MOZYME and conventional SCF calculations, particularly the calculation of
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub>, can be significant.&nbsp; A single point 
calculation using MOZYME and conventional methods would produce essentially the 
same <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub>, and for the purposes of this 
discussion the results of a single SCF calculated by both methods can be 
regarded as being identical.&nbsp; The problem with different
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> occurs when multiple SCF calculations 
are performed, this is the situation in a geometry optimization or reaction path 
calculation.&nbsp; In such calculations, the LMOs that result from an SCF 
calculation are used as starting LMOs in the next SCF calculation.&nbsp; In the 
first SCF calculation, the starting LMOs are exact - they form rigorously 
orthonormal sets, one for the occupied and one for the virtual sets.&nbsp; At the end of the SCF, small errors arising from truncation of the LMOs and 
incomplete pairwise rotations give rise to a small degradation of the 
orthonormal nature of the LMOs.&nbsp; In a single SCF, this degradation is 
unimportant, but when many SCF calculations are done, the loss of orthonormality 
increases steadily.&nbsp; This manifests itself as an error in the calculated
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> and to a much smaller extent in the 
gradients, and therefore, by implication, in the geometry.&nbsp; The loss of orthonormality 
could be corrected by re-orthogonalizing the LMOs, but the CPU cost of this is 
great, and  re-othogonalization is not done by default, although it can 
be done if desired using <a href="reorthog.html"><tt>REORTHOG</tt></a>.&nbsp;  Fortunately, a very simple 
procedure exists to completely correct this error:&nbsp; After any long run 
involving many MOZYME SCF calculations, use the final geometry generated as the 
starting point for a 1SCF calculation, and then use the <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> 
from that calculation.&nbsp; This strategy should be used:</p>
<p>(A) In global optimizations.</p>
<p>(B) In transition state location runs.</p>
<p>(C) At the end of IRC runs.</p>
<p>Do not use <a href="oldens.html"><tt>OLDENS</tt></a> as that would re-use the 
now-inaccurate sets of LMOs, and thus defeat the purpose of doing the 1SCF 
calculation.&nbsp; As mentioned above, the errors in the gradient are small, so 
the geometry is essentially unaffected by the loss of orthonormality.&nbsp; 
However, it is still a good practice to optimize geometries in three or more 
separate runs, if only to provide an opportunity to check that the calculation 
is proceeding as intended.</p>
<p>During geometry optimizations, the error in&nbsp;
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> caused by the deterioration of the 
LMOs can result in the energy rising near the end of the run.&nbsp; If this 
happens, the lowest energy structure will be output, instead of the last 
structure calculated.</p>
<p>By default, the M.O.s printed are LMOs.&nbsp; If canonical M.O.s are needed, 
use keyword <a href="eigen.html"><tt>EIGEN</tt></a>. EIGEN uses a large amount of 
memory and might not work if the system is too large.&nbsp; Even if it does 
work, it might take a lot of CPU time, so <tt>EIGEN</tt> should only be used with <tt>
<a href="one_scf.html">1SCF</a></tt>.</p>
<h3><b>Memory considerations: </b>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With 1Gb of RAM, systems of up to 10,000 atoms can be run without paging.&nbsp; 
Above about 11,000 atoms, paging becomes severe, and jobs take longer than 
necessary.&nbsp; With 2Gb of RAM, systems of up to 18,500 atoms can be run 
without significant paging.&nbsp; A system of 36,774 atoms ran successfully 
using 8.2Gb of memory, but each geometry optimization cycle took about two 
hours.</p>
<p>If polarizabilities are required, use <tt>
<font color="#0000ff"><a href="static.html"><u>STATIC</u></a></font></tt>.&nbsp; If keyword <tt>
<a href="polar.html">POLAR</a></tt> 
is used, then
<tt><a href="static.html">STATIC</a></tt> will be used instead.</p>
<p>The total charge on the system must be correct. If itÂ’s not, the charge will be changed to that predicted by the
<a href="Lewis_structures.html">Lewis structure</a>.&nbsp; To prevent the charge being changed, use
<a href="charge.html"><tt>CHARGE=n</tt></a>, even in cases where the system is neutral, 
i.e., <tt>CHARGE=0</tt>.&nbsp;If <tt>CHARGE=n</tt> 
is present, then any mistake made by MOZYME will be trapped and reported as soon 
as the job starts.&nbsp; If <tt>CHARGE=n</tt> is not present, then the charge predicted by 
the Lewis structure will be used.</p>
<h3>Limitations of MOZYME </h3>
<ul>
<li>Only closed shell RHF calculations are allowed. This means that <tt>MOZYME</tt> 
  calculations are limited to species in their ground state. Radicals and 
  electronic excited states cannot be run.&nbsp; Ions that are definitely 
  open-shell, such as Cr(III), cannot be run.&nbsp; Only pre-set oxidation 
  states are allowed, e.g. C<sup>IV</sup> and Au<sup>I</sup>.&nbsp; Oxidation 
  states of metals can be changed using the <a href="metal.html"><tt>METAL</tt></a> 
  keyword, e.g. <tt>METAL=(Au(+3))</tt>.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The results are not so precise, so for runs that need high precision (such 
  as <tt><a href="force.html">FORCE</a></tt> calculations), <tt>MOZYME</tt> is 
  discouraged.&nbsp; For proteins in particular, use a larger gradient 
  norm criterion, e.g. <a href="gnorm.html"><tt>GNORM=5</tt>,</a> this will reduce the 
  possibility of convergence failure.</li>
<li>For large systems, the recommended geometry optimizer is <tt>
<a href="lbfgs.html">LBFGS</a></tt>. This is 
  a modified BFGS optimizer designed to minimize memory usage, and is the 
  default for systems of 2000 parameters or more. If <tt>LBFGS</tt> 
  is not wanted for any reason, then use <tt>
<a href="bfgs.html">BFGS</a></tt>, 
  although it uses a lot more memory. The default optimizer, <tt>
<a href="ef.html">EF</a></tt>, uses a 
  large amount of memory, and should therefore not be used in optimizing the 
  geometry of large systems. In addition, because it uses a matrix inversion, it 
  becomes very time consuming for large systems. <a name="BM2587">&nbsp;</a> </li>
<li>Electrostatic Potentials cannot be calculated, that is <tt>
<u>
<a href="esp.html">
<font color="#0000ff">ESP</font></a></u></tt> cannot be used, however the 
  Parametric Molecular Electrostatic Potential,&nbsp; <tt>
<u>
<a href="pmep.html">
<font color="#0000ff">PMEP</font></a></u></tt>, can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In some cases, the MOZYME SCF solution is incorrect</h3>
<p>In some very specific cases, the MOZYME method can give rise to an incorrect 
SCF, specifically the MOZYME SCF solution corresponds to an electronic excited state.&nbsp; 
None of these cases ever occur in protein chemistry, unless severe errors are 
made, but users should be aware of 
their existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The commonest incorrect SCF solutions are obtained 
when the system should not be represented by a Lewis structure.&nbsp; A much 
rarer type of error is found in some helical buckytubes when periodic boundary 
conditions are imposed.&nbsp; In cases of this type, the Lewis structure 
generator simply fails to make the correct Lewis structure, and instead attempts 
to correct a faulty structure by assigning charges to two or more carbon 
atoms.&nbsp; In all instances where incorrect SCF solutions are found, the 
correct solution can be obtained by the appropriate use of <tt>
<a href="CVB.html">CVB</a></tt> or <tt><a href="setpi.html">SETPI</a>.</tt></p><h3><a name="SECTION0073116200000000000000">Recommended use of MOZYME</a> </h3>
<p><tt>MOZYME</tt> can be used for simple geometric calculations, such as 
geometry optimization, transition state location, and intrinsic and dynamic reaction 
coordinates, and for the calculation of polarizability. For these calculations,
<tt>MOZYME</tt> can be run as a "stand alone" calculation. If a partial geometry 
optimization is run, then the use of keyword <a href="rapid.html"><tt>RAPID</tt></a> should be 
considered. </p>
<p>For calculation of vibrational frequencies, frequency-dependent 
polarizability,  and electronic excited states, <tt>MOZYME</tt> should be 
run first, to optimize the geometry, then a conventional <tt>MOPAC</tt> 
calculation run. </p>
<p>Another effective strategy is to run a <tt>MOZYME</tt> job, followed by a <tt>
MOPAC</tt> job, using the <tt>
<a href="oldgeo.html">OLDGEO</a></tt> 
feature. When geometry optimizations are being run, a <tt>MOZYME</tt> job can be 
run for a time, then a <tt>MOPAC</tt> job run, using <tt>
<a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></tt>. That 
is, the <tt>RESTART</tt> function will work when a geometry optimization or 
transition state location calculation is run, regardless of the method used in 
generating the SCF. </p>
