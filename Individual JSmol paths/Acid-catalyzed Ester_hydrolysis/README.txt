Locating the transition state geometry using LOCATE-TS is the easiest technique to use for this reaction.

When the transition state is located using SADDLE, the results are similar, but for unknown reasons the only refinement that worked was NLLSQ, and even then the IRC looks unnatural.

The system "4 Acetic acid H3O(+) plus ethanol (Relaxed)" represents the lowest-energy conformer for the hydrolyzed ester.

It is possible to show how the partial atomic charges change during a reaction, this is illustrated in "Hydrolysis with charges IRC"
