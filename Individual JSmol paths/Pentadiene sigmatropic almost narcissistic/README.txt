Reactions that are not quite narcissistic can still be modeled as if they were narcissistic.  The main difference being that an extra step is required to refine the transition state.  In the example shown here, the reaction to be modeled is:

1-Methyl cyclopenta-2,4-diene <=> 1-Methyl cyclopenta-1,3-diene 

This involves the migration of a hydrogen atom from the C1 position to the C5 position. By making the assumption that the transition state geometry would have the migrating hydrogen atom approximately equidistant from C1 and C5, symmetry can be used in the optimization of this approximation to the transition state geometry.

The transition state geometry can then be refined starting from this approximate geometry by using TS. 

This strategy is useful for the SN2 family of reactions.
