<p class="auto-style1">All files used here can be downloaded from
<a href="homolytic.zip">homolytic.zip</a>.&nbsp; Due to small changes in 
precision and operating systems, a duplication of the following sequence might 
not be possible, however if the method used in generating the sequence is 
followed, similar results can be expected. </p>

Stretching C57 - C54 bond</a> until is breaks. <br>Click on &quot;Script&quot; to 
orientate system and display distances.<br>Model 10 is the highest energy 
system. In going to Model 11, the hydrogen on HOCO changes from being <em>cis</em> 
to being <em>trans</em>. At Model 23, the hydrogen on HOCO forms a hydrogen-bond 
with S60.<br>The geometry in the data-set is all Cartesian, except for C57, 
which is in internal coordinates.</p>

&quot;Script&quot; to orientate system and display distances.<br>This system starts at the 
geometry in Model 13 in &quot;path UHF&quot; The &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of Model 13 is -433.194 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. 
As the C - C distance is reduced, the energy drops steadily until Model 13.&nbsp; 
Because the hydrogen on HOCO is now <i>trans</i>, the starting energy is 
-472.581 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, instead of -475.152 at the start of the &quot;path 
UHF&quot; trajectory.&nbsp; Model 4, at -436.721 looks like a good candidate for a 
transition state calculation.</p>

&quot;Specific Script&quot; to orientate system and display distances.<br>Now the C54 - 
C57 bond is at the transition-state geometry, and two hydrogen bonds are made 
between the HOCO and the rest of the system.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Files of type &quot;UHF FORCE&quot; - verify the transition state 
geometry.<br>This works out the vibrational frequencies of the transition state.&nbsp; 
One &quot;negative&quot; vibration is expected, two, at&nbsp; -139.1 and -83.6 cm<sup>-1</sup> 
are found.<br>By adding keyword &quot;ISOTOPE&quot; a restart file is made.&nbsp; This 
will save time in the next two calculations.</p>

<a href="IRC%20path%201.html">Map the IRC from reactants to products for 
imaginary vibration 2</a>.<br>Both IRC's, from vibrations 1 and 2, produce 
more-or-less the same plot.&nbsp; The starting point for the IRC is the 
separated HOCO, and the ending point is the similar to that in &quot;path UHF 
reverse&quot; i.e., the C-C bond is intact.</p>
