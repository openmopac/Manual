 Derivatives</a>
</h2>
Solid-state derivatives with respect to geometry are handled differently from
molecule derivatives.  If the Cartesian coordinate derivatives are printed,
using <tt><a href="debug.html">DEBUG</a></tt> and <tt><a href="dcart.html">DCART</a></tt>, then for a molecule with an  optimized
geometry all the derivatives will be zero.  This is  not the case for an
infinite system.
<p>
An infinite system is represented by cell supplied by the user, called the
Central Unit Cell, or the CUC, and the cells surrounding this CUC. When
<tt>DCART</tt>, <tt>LARGE</tt>, and <tt>DEBUG</tt> are used in an infinite system
calculation for which  the geometry has been optimized, the Cartesian
derivatives for all unit cells are output. Many of these will be quite large,
up to about 60 kcal/mol/&Aring;.  This is not an error, rather it is a peculiarity
of the way solid-state derivatives are stored.
</p><p>
The Cartesian derivatives of the CUC represent the sum of all forces acting on
the atoms of the CUC due to all the atoms in the CUC.  Thus, if the atoms in
the CUC are the set (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>,<i>e</i>,<i>f</i>), then the Cartesian  derivatives
for atom <i>a</i> represent the forces on <i>a</i> due to the set
(<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>,<i>e</i>,<i>f</i>).  The Cartesian derivatives of atom <i>a</i> do <em>NOT</em>
include terms from  the surrounding unit cells.  Because of this, those atoms
in the CUC  which are at the cell boundaries are likely to have large
derivatives.
</p><p>
The Cartesian derivatives of the surrounding unit cells represent the  forces
acting on the atoms in those cells arising from the atoms of the CUC.  Again,
this is an unbalanced set of forces, and those atoms near to the cell
boundaries are likely to have large resultant forces.
</p><p>
It is possible to evaluate the total, balanced, forces acting on the atoms of
the CUC.  This is done by simply adding the forces acting on the atoms of the
three unit cells.  When the keywords given above are used, the last part of the
derivative output consists of the forces acting on the CUC itself.
</p><p>
Only by representing the forces in this unusual manner can the information
necessary for calculating the derivative of the translation vector be
generated.
