<h3>
Debug Support and Known Limitations
</h3>
<p>
<b>Software bugs</b></p>
<p>
Although MOPAC is routinely maintained in the status of no known software bugs,
problems do occur.  If a user suspects that there is a bug in the program,
assistance can be requested by telephone or E-mail, with E-mail being preferred.  Suspected bugs are
given a high priority, and most are resolved within one working day.  In the
case  of genuine bugs, a bug-fix or patch is provided to the user.
</p><p>
<b>Known Limitations</b></p><p>
The following list identifies faults or limitations in the current MOPAC.&nbsp;
These items have not been corrected up to now for the following reasons:<br/>
(A) The problem would require more work than can be justified at this time.&nbsp;
In other words, the problem is difficult to correct.<br/>
(B) the problem is not regarded as having a high enough priority.<br/>
If you are of the opinion that a bug on this list should be corrected, please
inform me <a href="mailto:(openmopac@gmail.com">(openmopac@gmail.com</a>).<br/>
If a limitation of MOPAC is identified, and communicated to me, I will either
add it to this list, or have the limitation corrected (removed).</p><p>
1. Excited state Mulliken populations are incorrect.&nbsp; They use the
wavefunction from the SCF, not the C.I. The Coulson density is correct.&nbsp;
This problem was discovered and reported by: Victor I. Danilov, Department of
Quantum Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine, Kiev 143, Ukraine.</p></body></html>
