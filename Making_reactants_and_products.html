<h1 class="auto-style1"><font face="Arial"><b>Chymotrypsin mechanism: Making reactants and 
products</b></font></h1>
<h2 class="auto-style4">General</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;There are several steps in any enzyme-catalyzed reaction; 
these are minima on the potential energy surface, and, except for the first and 
last steps, are usually referred to as intermediates.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 
about six steps in the mechanism for the hydrolysis of a peptide bond using 
chymotrypsin, a well-understood process.&nbsp; In other 
enzyme-catalyzed reactions the mechanism might be less well understood.&nbsp; 
This is, however, not a serious limitation, in that an attempt can be made to construct a 
mechanism, and that mechanism can then be modeled.&nbsp; New information can 
then be obtained from the resulting model, and this can then be used to modify 
the mechanism.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style2">All mechanisms should start with a well-behaved starting 
model.&nbsp; This model should contain all the parts that will be used in the 
mechanism. In the case here, chymotrypsin, the essential parts are: (a) The 
protein chymotrypsin, (b) the substrate, and (c) the water molecule that will be 
consumed in the hydrolysis.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style4">Methods for making steps in the reaction mechanism</h2>
<p class="auto-style4">Building the first step, the starting model, requires a large amount of human 
effort.&nbsp; This has already been <a href="Chymotrypsin_starting_model.html">described</a> 
for chymotrypsin, and will not be elaborated on 
here. It is sufficient to say that the starting model is valid.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">In Step 2, the Ser195 hydroxyl oxygen forms a covalent bond with the peptide 
carbonyl carbon of Trp252; at the same time, the hydroxyl hydrogen migrates to 
His57.&nbsp; Simply moving the atoms towards each other and hoping that when the 
geometry is optimized they will be covalently bound is one option, but in most 
cases an operation of this type requires a good GUI and a lot of skill.&nbsp; 
Two strategies are recommended for modifying one stable system to form another 
stable system.&nbsp; First, the modification can be performed using JSmol.&nbsp; 
Three types of <a href="JSmol_examples/MOPAC_JSmol.html">examples</a> of the 
JSmol editor are:&nbsp; A simple hydrogen migration, an enol to keto reaction, 
and the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate.&nbsp; Operations of this kind 
are easy to perform using JSmol.&nbsp; The second method is to do everything 
using MOPAC.&nbsp; This is more difficult to set up, and takes considerably 
longer to run, but is much more versatile than JSmol.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Examples of using MOPAC to make stable systems are as follows:</h2>
<h3 class="auto-style4">Use of a reaction path to make a covalent bond</h3>
<p class="auto-style4">A covalent bond can be made by using a reaction path to lower the interatomic 
distance between a pair of atoms that were initially well separated.&nbsp; This 
is done using a reaction coordinate, here the inter-atomic distance.&nbsp; 
Enzyme geometries are normally always expressed in Cartesian coordinates, but an 
interatomic distance requires internal coordinates.&nbsp; This means that one 
atom in the model must be defined in internal coordinates while all the other 
atoms are expressed in Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; To set up the internal 
coordinate, look at the atom numbers of the two atoms that are to be moved 
together.&nbsp; The atom with the higher number will be the moving atom, atom
<strong>A</strong>, the atom with the lower number will be the atom that the 
moving atom moves to, atom <strong>NA</strong>.&nbsp; Using a GUI, measure the 
distance between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>NA</strong>.&nbsp; Internal 
coordinates need an angle and a dihedral angle (a torsion angle), so select 
another atom to be used in defining an angle, atom <strong>NB</strong> and a 
dihedral, <strong>NC</strong>, and measure the angles <strong>A-NA-NB</strong> 
and <strong>A-NA-NB-NC</strong>. Edit the data set to replace the Cartesian 
coordinates of atom <strong>A</strong> with the new internal coordinates.&nbsp; Set the 
optimization flag to "-1" for the distance, and the optimization flags for the 
angle and dihedral to "1"&nbsp; An example of 
such an edited file would be:</p><pre>

<p class="auto-style4">Here the carbonyl carbon in Trp 252, PDB label   <span class="auto-style3">"</span>C&nbsp;&nbsp; TRP C 
252<span class="auto-style3">"</span>, is separated from the oxygen

and a dihedral of 116&deg; with  "CA&nbsp; SER G 195".</p>
<p class="auto-style4">A useful alternative to using atom numbers when defining 
the connectivity is to use <a href="atom_numbers.html">atom labels</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style4"><strong>WARNING:</strong> A common problem occurs when 
the atom serial numbers in a PDB file are mistakenly used as atom numbers, and 
are then used for defining <strong>NA</strong>,<strong> NB</strong>, and<strong> 
NC</strong>. Serial numbers in a PDB file include non-atoms, for example a "TER" 
record (indicating the end of a chain) increments the serial number by one. 
Every time a "TER" is present the atom serial numbers for all subsequent atoms 
increases by one relative to the atom number.&nbsp; If you really want to use 
atom numbers, then to avoid this problem, run a <tt><a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a> </tt>
job using the system being studied.&nbsp; Use the output to identify the atom 
numbers to be used for<strong> NA</strong>,<strong> NB</strong>, and<strong> NC</strong>. 
(Tip: Check that the coordinate of the atom in the output file is the same as 
that in the GUI.)</p>
<p><span class="auto-style4">Keywords for the reaction path can then be specified.&nbsp; In this case the 
keywords would be</span> <tt><a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=30</a> <a href="step.html">
STEP=-0.2</a> <a href="point.html">POINTS=5</a></tt>.<span class="auto-style4"> This job is then run. This 
will take several hours.&nbsp; The normal reaction path accuracy is not needed, 
so the job can be run relatively quickly by using a large step and a large 
gradient criterion.</span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style4">Edit the results to make a new data set. To replace the internal coordinates 
by Cartesian, change the distance optimization flag from "-1" to "1" and use keywords</span> <tt>0SCF <a href="xyz.html">
XYZ</a></tt>. 
<span class="auto-style4">Then using a GUI, inspect the region of interest, here the region around atoms 
3485 and 2737. In this specific case, the hydroxyl hydrogen is still attached to 
the Ser195 oxygen atom.&nbsp; Using the GUI, move this hydrogen atom so that it 
is ca. 1.0&Aring; from the ring nitrogen of His57.&nbsp; The resulting structure is 
then run normally.</span></p>
<h3 class="auto-style4">Use of a reaction path to move two moieties apart or to break a covalent bond</h3>
<p class="auto-style4">Sometimes it is necessary to break a covalent bond or to separate two atoms 
that are near to each other. If the resulting structure is not known, it is 
easier to simply increase the distance between the atom pairs.&nbsp; This is in 
contrast to the previous section, where two atoms are pulled together, and a 
bond may or may not break.&nbsp; In the case being described here, two atoms are 
pushed apart, and other bonds may or may not make.</p>
<p class="auto-style4">An example of this type of process occurs in going from Step 3 to Step 4.&nbsp; 
In Step 3, there is an amine in close proximity to the tetrahedral carbon; the N 
- C distance being only 1.72 &Aring;.&nbsp; In going from Step 3 to Step 4, the 
N - C distance is steadily increased.&nbsp; The "reaction path" would be defined 
on the keyword line by "GNORM=20 STEP=0.1 POINTS=15"&nbsp; A lower GNORM is used 
here, because the actual path is now of interest, not just the end product.&nbsp; 
The step-size is positive because the interatomic separation is increasing.&nbsp; 
15 steps should be sufficient to increase the separation to ~ 3.2 &Aring;.

<h3 class="auto-style4">Proton shifts and other very simple steps</h3>
<p><span class="auto-style4">If the only significant change is a proton shift or other very simple 
re-arrangement, then moving the atom "by hand" using a GUI is simplest.&nbsp; In 
going from Step 2 to Step 3, a proton, initially on His57, migrates to the 
nitrogen atom on Thr253.&nbsp; Using a GUI, identify the proton on His57, then 
move it so that it is near to the nitrogen of Thr253.&nbsp; It is helpful during 
this process to hide the rest of the model.&nbsp; Look at the His57 - Thr253 
assembly from different orientations, to check that the proton is where it 
should be.&nbsp; Then, once everything looks correct, optimize the geometry of 
Step 3.</span>&nbsp; </p>
