<h1><font face="Arial">Identifying and exploring the Active site</font></h1>
<p>The active site - the part of an enzyme where covalent bonds are made or 
broken - is the most important part of the entire system. A knowledge of the 
features of the active site is essential for understanding the mechanism of 
catalysis.&nbsp; Using a GUI, locate the active site - this is probably best 
done using residue numbers - then look for features in the vicinity of the 
active site that might be of interest.</p>
<p>For example, using 1AFQ, a chymotrypsin protease with a synthetic inhibitor, 
the active site consists of His57, Asp102, and Ser195, all on chain "B".&nbsp; 
Near these three residues, known as the catalytic triad, are a water molecule, 
HOH 603, 
and the inhibitor, 4-fluorobenzylamine, FBA D 303.&nbsp; If the process of 
preparing a starting model had been carried out, then the Asp will be ionized, 
there will be a hydrogen atom attached to a nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring, 
pointing towards the Asp(-), and the Ser alcohol hydrogen will be hydrogen 
bonding to the other nitrogen atom on the imidazole ring.</p>
<h2>Explore the active site</h2>
<p>When the instructions for preparing a starting model are used with 1AFQ, the 
resulting structure is the classical active 
site for 1AFQ.&nbsp; In this structure, the Asp102 is ionized, His57 is neutral, 
and the Ser195 hydrogen-bonds to the imidazole ring nitrogen.</p>
<p>Various suggestions have been proposed for&nbsp; One suggestion has been that the proton between the His and 
the Asp should not be on the His, instead it should be on the Asp. </p>
