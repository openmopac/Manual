<h1 class="auto-style1">Examples of the use of JSmol with MOPAC </h1>
<h2>Modeling geometries</h2>
<p><strong>Active site in </strong> <a href="Chymotrypsin%20Step%202.html">
<strong>Chymotrypsin, Step 2</strong></a>: Interesting parts of a protein can be 
displayed.&nbsp; In this example, Ser195 has formed a tetrahedral intermediate 
with the peptide carbon joining Trp252 and Thr253.&nbsp; Well-known features, 
such as the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole can easily be seen.&nbsp; By 
toggling individual residues all the features in chymotrypsin can be explored 
easily.</p>
<h2>Editing geometries</h2>
<strong>Make a salt bridge by </strong> <a href="Move%20a%20hydrogen%20atom.html">
<strong>moving a 
hydrogen atom</strong></a>: This is the simplest editing operation - moving a 
single atom, then using the new coordinates to update the PDB file<p><strong>Modify a residue 
to convert from a site from </strong>
<a href="Convert%20enol%20into%20ketol.html"><strong>enol to keto</strong></a><strong> 
form, then optimize the resulting geometry:</strong> A more complicated 
operation - moving several atoms, then writing out a small block of coordinates 
in PDB format that can be used for updating the PDB file.&nbsp; This operation 
is much easier to perform if all atoms in each residue are together in the 
original PDB file.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><a href="Make%20a%20covalent%20bond.html">Make a covalent bond</a> 
between two atoms:</strong>&nbsp; Forcing two atoms together to form a covalent 
bond requires other atoms in the region to move.&nbsp; This example is extreme, 
in that a covalent bond is broken and two covalent bonds are formed, and many 
atoms move.</p>
<p><a href="Chymotrypsin%20Make%20Step%202.html"><strong>Make Step 2</strong></a><strong> 
in the Chymotrypsin mechanism:</strong>&nbsp; This is similar to the previous 
step, but in chymotrypsin, the serine hydrogen moves on to the imidazolium ring 
of His57.</p>
<strong><span class="auto-style4">Notes:</span> </strong>
<span class="auto-style3">Other geometric operations, such as changing one atom 
to another, e.g., changing a carbon atom to a nitrogen atom, or adding hydrogen 
atoms, should not be done using JSmol.&nbsp; Instead, edit the PDB file 
directly, to change element names, and add hydrogen atoms using MOPAC.</span><h2>Animations</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">Follow a normal mode of vibration:
<a href="Formaldehyde_vib.html">CH<sub>2</sub>O</a>.&nbsp; This example is for a 
time-dependent normal mode of vibration for formaldehyde.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Follow the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate for a reaction:
<a href="HCN-HNC%20Intrinsic%20Reaction%20Coordinate.html">HCN &harr; HNC</a> .&nbsp; 
This is the time-independent path for the isomerization of HCN to HNC.&nbsp; The 
most important points are the starting point, the transition state, and the 
finishing point for the reaction.</p>
