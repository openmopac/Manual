<h1>Comparing two proteins</h1>
<p>Any two proteins can be compared using a utility within MOPAC.&nbsp; The 
general form of the data set that allows two proteins to be compared consists of 
two or three lines: keywords, title, and if wanted a comment line. A minimum set 
of keywords would consist of <a href="geo_dat.html"><tt>
GEO_DAT</tt></a>, <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a>,
<a href="compare.html"><tt>COMPARE</tt></a> and <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>. 
A useful keyword to add is <a href="output.html"><tt>OUTPUT</tt></a>; this reduces the 
size of the results, and allows the important material to be found more easily.&nbsp; 
The results of a 
comparison consist of a standard output file that gives a detailed description 
of the relationship between the two proteins, their similarities and their 
differences, a HTML web-page, a PDB file for each of the two proteins, and other 
less-important files.&nbsp; Individual differences can be easily seen by opening 
the JSmol HTML web-page and using the options provided.</p>
<p>Several types of comparison can 
be done, among these are:</p>
<h3>Comparing two raw PDB files</h3>
<p>Raw PDB files often have the suffix ".pdb"; this would present a problem 
because, during the comparison of two proteins, files that end in ".pdb" are 
generated.&nbsp; If not stopped, these new files would over-write the originals.&nbsp; 
To avoid this, the input files must not end in ".pdb" so a necessary first step 
would be to re-name any original PDB files that end in ".pdb" to give them a 
different suffix.&nbsp; A suitable new suffix would be ".ent"&nbsp; </p>
<p>Comparison of two closely-related structures can be illustrated using the 
small protein Crambin, for which two high-resolution PDB entries 
exist: 1EJG and 1CBN.&nbsp; These can be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank; 
they have the default names 1EJG.pdb and 1CBN.pdb.&nbsp; Re-name them to 
1EJG.ent and 1CBN.ent, then make up a data set, Compare_1EJG_and_1CBN.mop, that 
contains the two lines:</p><pre><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>="1EJG.ent" <a href="geo_ref.html">GEO_REF</a>="1CBN.ent" <a href="compare.html">COMPARE</a> <a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a>
Comparison of two PDB structures for Crambin </pre>
<p>(MOPAC file-names can have spaces, but it's easier to use the underscore when 
describing files; with underscores, where the file name starts and ends is 
obvious.)</p>
<p>If this job is run, the two proteins will be compared.</p>
<p>Comparing two hydrogenated PDB files</p>
<p>When two or more PDB entries represent the same system, there is a natural 
strong desire to compare the various structures.&nbsp; A good example is 
provided by the small protein Crambin, for which two high-resolution PDB entries 
exist: 1EJG and 1CBN.</p>
<p>Any comparison of the heats of formation of different structures requires 
that the various structures have the same formula.&nbsp; Examination of 1EJG and 
1CBN reveals that 1CBN has a hetero-group, C<sub>2</sub>O, this moiety is missing in 
1EJG.&nbsp; From the PDB remarks, the entity is identified as ethanol, and 
indeed 
when 1CBN is hydrogenated (<a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt></a>), six 
hydrogen atoms are added to it to form ethanol.&nbsp; Before proceeding 
therefore, the molecule that is present in one entry but not in the other must 
be deleted.&nbsp; These two high-resolution structures are unusual in that the 
PDB entries include the hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Almost always, small mistakes can 
be found in the PDB entries; these two systems are not exceptions, therefore 
disregard the supplied hydrogen atoms, and re-hydrogenate before proceeding.&nbsp; 
This will ensure that hydrogenation is consistent.&nbsp; Of course, if any 
special circumstances exist - such as known ionized sites or warning messages in 
the LOG file, small changes might be necessary to correct these errors.&nbsp; 
The objective is to ensure that each entry&nbsp; has exactly the same formula.</p>
<p>To compare two structures, use keyword <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a>. To use this 
utility, make two data sets, one for each structure.&nbsp; In one data set - 
either one will do - add <tt>GEO_REF=&lt;text&gt;</tt> where 
<tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt> indicates the other 
structure, and also add keywords <a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>
0SCF</tt></a> and <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>, if the JSmol utility is 
installed.&nbsp; Run the 
job; it will produce a new PDB file; this is the 
re-sequenced <tt>GEO_REF </tt>structure optimized for overlap.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If this operation is not done at this point, the lack of maximum overlap 
might 
cause severe problems later on.&nbsp; </p>
