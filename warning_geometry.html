WARNING -- GEOMETRY IS NOT AT A STATIONARY POINT</h1>
<p>Normally when a geometry optimization is complete, the geometry is is at a 
stationary point, that is, the forces acting on all atoms are below a preset 
limit.&nbsp; There are three exceptions to this: (A) if some atoms are 
constrained (frozen or fixed), (B) a very rare case that occurs when internal 
coordinate gradients are small but the Cartesian derivatives are large, and (C) 
there is a bug in MOPAC&nbsp; that causes the internal coordinates to be 
artificially small (no instance of this has occurred to date)&nbsp; Whenever the 
calculated gradient norm, "GRADIENT NORM" in the output and ARC files, is small 
and the Cartesian gradient norm (not normally printed) is large, then the 
warning message: "<font color="#FF0000">WARNING -- GEOMETRY IS NOT AT A STATIONARY POINT</font>" 
will be printed.&nbsp; The action to take depends in which of the exception 
cases (A), (B), or (C) has occurred.</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; If some atoms are constrained, for example by one or more 
optimization flags being set to zero, or by being a symmetry-dependent atom, 
then there is a high probability that the warning will be printed.&nbsp; If the 
constraints are intended, then do nothing - the warning can be ignored.&nbsp; If 
the constraints are incorrect, then correct them and re-run.</p>
<p>B: The simplest way to correct this error is to run the job in Cartesian 
coordinates.&nbsp; To do this, add keywords OPT and XYZ.&nbsp; An alternative 
would be to re-write the internal coordinates.&nbsp; To do this, use keywords 
0SCF and INT.</p>
<p>C: Please send the data set and output to openmopac|at|gmail.com</p>
