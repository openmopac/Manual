<h1 align="center">Examples of calculations involving Proteins</h1>
<h2 align="left"><u>Preparing a raw data dataset</u></h2>
<p align="left">One of the best resources for starting protein structures is the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a>. The PDB 
contains structures for a huge number of proteins, and is being continuously 
updated.&nbsp; Not all structures are of high accuracy, for example older X-ray 
structures often have unrealistic interatomic distances, however in such cases 
the tertiary structures are still good enough for all routine work.&nbsp; NMR 
structures should be avoided - whenever NMR geometries are optimized, the RMS 
difference between the optimized and NMR structure is much larger than the X-ray 
equivalent.</p>
<h3 align="left">Choice of PDB structure</h3>
<p align="left">Before starting work on proteins, careful thought should be 
given to deciding what it is that is to be done.&nbsp; If the objective is to 
compare the predicted structure with the X-ray structure, then almost any X-ray 
structure would do.&nbsp; If the objective is to model a reaction or a docked 
substrate, then a lot of human effort can be saved by selecting a structure that 
includes an inhibitor.&nbsp; First of all, the inhibitor shows where the 
substrate should be and its approximate orientation.&nbsp; When the geometry is 
optimized, the inhibitor can then be converted into the desired substrate, and 
the geometry re-optimized to give either the reactants, transition state, or 
products. </p>
<p align="left">If there are several entries in the PDB that meet the desired 
criteria, then select the one that is most complete. Download the PDB source 
file, and edit it to make a MOPAC data set. MOPAC data sets can use internal or 
Cartesian coordinates, or a mixture of the two types.&nbsp; In protein 
work, use Cartesian coordinates for all atoms except when a reaction path is 
involved, in which case a single atom (the moving atom) would normally be in 
internal coordinates.&nbsp; </p>
<h3 align="left">Preconditioning</h3>
<p align="left">Most PDB entries lack hydrogen atoms, and many have positional 
or structural disorder.&nbsp; Fortunately, when the focus of the work is to 
model the active site, structural disorder is almost always unimportant - the 
difference between a Leu and an Ile far from the active site never affects the mechanism.&nbsp; Likewise, 
positional disorder is also unimportant.&nbsp; For positional disorder to exist, 
the energies of the two conformers must be similar, so obviously either one can 
be chosen.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Use a third-party program to add hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Ideally, 
that program would add hydrogen atoms correctly, but every program thus far examined has 
limitations.&nbsp; Most programs look at a residue, and decide whether to ionize 
it without consideration of the environment.&nbsp; So if the sequence -Glu-Glu-Glu- 
were to occur, all three residues would be ionized; this can result in 
unrealistic charges.&nbsp; To see why, consider a dicarboxylic acid, e.g., 
succinic acid. The first pKa might be low, but the second is inevitably high, 
indicative of the fact that the di-ion is unstable.&nbsp; A useful strategy to 
avoid unrealistic states of ionization is to first neutralize all charges.&nbsp; 
This is not as drastic as it sounds - during the geometry optimization, protons 
can migrate from acid to base residues to form salt bridges.&nbsp; If a specific 
proton does not migrate, the data set can be edited so that the proton is moved. 
After re-optimizing the geometry, the decision can be made regarding the 
preferred state based on the total heat of formation.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Once the hydrogen atoms have been added, run a calculation 
using the  keywords&nbsp; <tt> <a href="charges.html">CHARGES</a></tt> and <tt>
<a href="residues.html">RESIDUES</a></tt>.&nbsp; In the output, check for the 
message "Residues where the number of hydrogen atoms is not equal to that 
expected."&nbsp; If the message exists, carefully examine the residues indicated.&nbsp; 
If any residues are ionized, edit the data set to remove the ionization.&nbsp; 
Any residues that are not recognized are the result of either a mistake, in which case 
correct it, or are a hetero group - a non-standard residue.&nbsp; If that 
is the case, use <a href="xeno.html"><tt>XENO</tt></a> to allow it to be recognized.&nbsp; 
It is not necessary that all residues be&nbsp; recognized in order for the calculation to run, 
but when they are all properly identified, the probability of errors in the data 
set is reduced.&nbsp; Also check any hetero groups, such as heme or retinal, to 
verify that the hydrogenation is correct.</p>
<h3 align="left">Preliminary geometry optimization - Hydrogen atoms only</h3>
<p align="left">Before optimizing the entire structure, a useful operation is to 
optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; This is done using
<a href="nooptx.html"><tt>NOOPT</tt></a> and <a href="optx.html"><tt>OPT-H</tt></a>. 
As this is only a rough calculation, there is no need for high precision, so two 
additional keywords can be used here, <a href="cutoff.html"><tt>CUTOFF=6</tt></a>, and
<a href="gnorm.html"><tt>GNORM=5</tt></a>.&nbsp; These keywords will reduce the 
CPU effort by over 50%.&nbsp; Once the geometry is optimized, check the 
ionization states.&nbsp; The "salt rules" should be obeyed: for every ionized 
residue, there should be a counterion near to it.&nbsp; Less strict, but still 
important, every possible hydrogen bond should exist. The one exception to the 
salt rules is that all Arg should be ionized.&nbsp; If any Arg are not ionized, 
ionize them "by hand" and if there are potential counterions nearby, ionize them 
to balance the charge.&nbsp; If there are no counterions, put a net charge on 
the system. When you're satisfied that the geometry is good, save a copy of the 
data set.&nbsp; This represents a clean starting point based on the PDB 
structure. In the following discussion, we'll refer to this structure as PDB.mop</p>
<p align="left">Another useful operation to do at this point is to re-sequence 
the atoms into the standard PDB format.&nbsp; This is done with keyword
<a href="reseq.html"><tt>RESEQ</tt></a>.&nbsp; After re-sequencing all atoms, 
particularly the hydrogen atoms, in the same residue are together.&nbsp; </p>
<h2 align="left"><u>Global optimization</u></h2>
<p align="left">First, if you haven't already done so, save a copy of the 
structure from the previous step.&nbsp; Things will go wrong naturally, so 
you'll want a fall-back position to re-start from when disaster occurs.&nbsp; 
For even average sized proteins, global optimization can take CPU days, so 
anything that can increase the efficiency of this process is worthwhile.&nbsp; 
The following sequence has been found to be efficient:</p>
<p align="left">(A) Using keywords <tt>CUTOFF=6 GNORM=10 OPT</tt>, perform a rough 
geometry optimization.&nbsp; During this process, the energy will drop rapidly 
at the start, then the rate of decrease will taper off. edit the resulting .arc 
file to make a new data set.<br/>
(B) Using keywords <tt>GNORM=5</tt>, perform a more precise 
optimization.&nbsp; The energy will continue to drop, but not as fast as in the 
previous step.&nbsp; Again edit the resulting .arc file to make a new data set.<br/>
(C) Run the new data set with <tt>1SCF</tt>, and carefully examine the 
output and .arc file to make sure that everything is correct.&nbsp; Pay 
particular attention to the active site and to important hetero groups such as 
HEME.</p>
<h3 align="left">Constrained optimization - biased to X-ray structure</h3>
<p align="left">Although X-ray structures are good, they can be improved by 
performing a constrained optimization.&nbsp; Most of the time, PM6&nbsp; bond 
lengths and angles are more accurate than X-ray structures, and in all cases 
X-ray tertiary structures are more accurate than those predicted by PM6.&nbsp; 
By combining the two approaches, structures of unprecedented accuracy can be 
obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure is similar to a global optimization, but 
instead of the optimization being unconstrained, a penalty function is added 
that limits the deviation from the X-ray structure.&nbsp; This penalty is very 
small for bond lengths and angles, but is large for tertiary structures.&nbsp; 
Setting up the calculation is similar to setting up a global optimization but 
with the extra keyword <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF=&lt;text&gt;</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
If the name of the constrained optimization data set is "opt.mop", and the X-ray 
data set is "pdb.mop", in folder "M:\PDB files" then the keyword used 
in opt.mop would be <tt>
GEO_REF=M:\PDB files\pdb.mop</tt>.</p>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr">Constrained optimization - Lock individual bond 
lengths and angles</h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Because protein geometries are normally defined in 
Cartesian coordinates, how can individual bond-lengths or angles be locked so 
that their values cannot be modified during the optimization?&nbsp; The answer 
is to define individual atoms using internal coordinates.&nbsp; Suppose, for 
example, that hydrogen atom 3000 needs to be defined as being 1.1
<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring; from oxygen atom 2999.&nbsp; Then using a 
graphics package, locate H3000 and O2999, and two other atoms that could be used 
in defining the angle and dihedral in an internal coordinate connectivity.&nbsp; 
Suitable atoms might be the atom O2999 is connected to (e.g. C2967) and the next 
atom (e.g. N2960).&nbsp; Of course any atoms could be used provided their 
atom-number is lower than the atom being defined, i.e. here lower than 3000.&nbsp; 
Once the four atoms (here H3000, O2999, C2967, and N2960) are identified, work 
out the angle and dihedral.&nbsp; Use these data in constructing the internal 
coordinate definition for H3000.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the H3000-O2999-C2967 angle was 
120&deg;, and the H3000-O2999-C2967-N2960 torsion was 180&deg;, then the position of the 
hydrogen atom with a fixed O-H distance would be:</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">H 1.1 0 120 1 180 1 2999 
2976 2960</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">If the angle needed to be 
fixed, then the line would be:</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">H 1.1 1 120 0 180 1 2999 
2976 2960</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">and so on.&nbsp; There is 
no restriction on the number of internal coordinates that can be used.&nbsp; 
Indeed, entire hetero groups can be defined as being rigid, but free to move 
within a cavity.&nbsp; In such a case, the first atom in the hetero group would 
be defined in either unconstrained internal or Cartesian coordinates, the next 
atom would be in internal coordinates and have its bond-length fixed, the next 
atom would be internal coordinates and have a frozen bond length and angle, and 
all the remaining atoms in the hetero group would be in internal coordinates and 
have all coordinates frozen.</font></p>
<h4 align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">The atoms to be used in 
the connectivity occur after the atom whose bond length or angle is to be locked</font></h4>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman">Quite often, the geometry 
does not allow a bond-length or angle to be defined, because the atoms that 
would be used in the connectivity are defined after the atom of interest.&nbsp; 
Fortunately, there is an easy way to solve this problem: the order of occurrence 
of Cartesian atoms is not important, so simply move the atoms to be used in the 
connectivity to before the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined.&nbsp; 
Alternatively, move the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined to the 
end of the data set.</font></p>
<h2 align="left" dir="ltr"><u><font face="Times New Roman">Location of 
Transition States</font></u></h2>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Location of transition states is a complicated process 
due to the great size of the systems involved.&nbsp; As with global 
optimization, great care must be exercised in ensuring that the calculations are 
going correctly.&nbsp; Many steps are involved, and as a result, the whole 
process requires a lot of human as well as CPU time.&nbsp; Therefore, before 
starting on a project to locate a transition state, carefully consider: it the 
result worth the effort.&nbsp; Do not start unless you are willing to expend a 
lot of effort, and be aware that success is not always achieved.&nbsp; Having 
said this, if you are still committed to locating transition states in chemical 
reactions, the main steps are as follows:</p>

</ul>
<h3 align="left" dir="ltr"><a name="Prepare_data_set">Prepare a data set that represents the reactants and 
products</a></h3>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Before any work is started on modeling 
enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the reaction to be investigated should be written 
out in the normal diagrammatic form.&nbsp; For example, during the aspartate 
protease catalyzed hydrolysis of a peptide bond, two or three distinct steps are 
involved, with the net result that a water molecule adds across the peptide bond 
to give rise to a carboxylic acid and an amine.&nbsp; This is, of necessity, a 
complicated process, so for convenience the mechanism is best expressed as the 
sum of a few distinct steps.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">A good starting point is the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a>.&nbsp; 
Positioning the reactants and products is difficult, fortunately there is a 
simple procedure that can be used to make both reactants and products.&nbsp; 
Enzymes can be rendered inactive by the addition of an inhibitor.&nbsp; This is 
normally a small molecule that has the approximate shape of a transition-state 
geometry, but is in fact a ground-state system.&nbsp; Many inhibitors are 
phosphorus V compounds, which mimic the enhanced valence of carbon in a 
transition state, for example <span hasbox="2">
IVA-VAL-VAL-LEU(P)-(O)PHE-ALA-ALA-OME in PDB entry 1QRP.&nbsp; 1QRP is an 
aspartate protease inactivated by a synthetic phosphate inhibitor.&nbsp; At 
first sight, this system might not appear to be a suitable model for a protease 
reaction, but by replacing the phosphate group with a peptide linkage and a 
water molecule, the system becomes more like the reactant ground state of a 
hydrolysis reaction.&nbsp; During the early stages of modeling hydrolysis, the 
nature of the groups attached to the peptide linkage are not critical, so these 
can be replaced with a small, innocuous, group such as methyl.&nbsp; The 
substrate is thus converted from&nbsp; IVA-VAL-VAL-LEU(P)-(O)PHE-ALA-ALA-OME to 
N-methyl acetamide plus water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the geometry of this system 
is optimized, the result is the reactant geometry.&nbsp; By adding the water 
molecule to the peptide bond, the tetrahedral intermediate can be made, and 
geometry optimization of this structure gives rise to the product geometry.</span></p>
