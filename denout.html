<tt>DENOUT, DENOUTF</tt> </h1>
<p>In a MOPAC calculation, the density matrix at the end of the calculation is to be output in a form suitable for input in another job. If an automatic dump due to the time being exceeded occurs during the current run, 
and <tt>DENOUT</tt> is present, then the density matrix will also be output. (see <tt>
<a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></tt>).&nbsp; The density matrix file is 
unformatted.&nbsp; To output the formatted file, use <tt>DENOUTF</tt>. </p>
<p>In both formatted and unformatted density files, the layout of the data is: 
Number of atomic orbitals, number of atoms, lower half triangle of density 
matrix elements.&nbsp; When the density file is used in a subsequent 
calculation, the number of atomic orbitals and number of atoms is compared with 
that expected.&nbsp; If they are different, an error message is printed, and the 
run is stopped.</p>
<p>In a MOZYME calculation, the LMOs at the end of the calculation are to be output in a form suitable for input in another job. If an automatic dump due to the time being exceeded occurs during the current run, 
and <tt>DENOUT</tt> is present, then the density matrix will also be output. (see <tt>RESTART</tt>).&nbsp; 
The formatted option, <tt>DENOUTF,</tt> is not available .</p>

The opposite of <tt>DENOUT</tt> is <tt><a href="oldens.html">OLDENS</a></tt>
