<TT>NOZERO ZERO</TT>

        In a PDB file, when the first residue in a protein chain has a negative 
number there is the possibility that a residue has the number zero.&nbsp; In 
some PDB files, the residue following &quot;-1&quot; is &quot;1&quot;, not &quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; If this 
situation occurs, and the original residue sequence has to be regenerated, 
special action must be taken to ensure that the residue following &quot;-1&quot; is 
correctly identified.&nbsp; If it should be &quot;0&quot;, then keyword <tt>ZERO</TT> must be 
present, if it should be &quot;1&quot; then keyword <tt>NOZERO</TT> must be present.<p>These 
keywords should not normally be used.&nbsp; They are only needed when the 
special conditions just described are met. If these conditions are met, a 
message explaining that one of these keywords must be selected and used in the 
job.</p>
