<h1><font face="Arial">Checking that the starting model is valid</font></h1>
<p>Before doing any serious modeling, it is very important that the starting 
model is as correct as possible.&nbsp; Effort spent here in validating the model 
will save wasting a lot of time later on.&nbsp; Of course, eliminating all 
errors is practically impossible, but if the number of errors is minimized, then 
the likelihood of the remaining errors causing problems later on is diminished.</p>
<h2>Use keyword <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a></h2>
<p>A simple web-page will be written when <tt>HTML</tt> is used.&nbsp; This 
web-page allows Firefox to open a <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol</a> script 
that can be used easily for examining details of proteins.&nbsp; Two steps need 
to be done to get this graphical user interface to work. First, JSmol needs to 
be installed, and second a minor change needs to be done to get Firefox to read 
local web-pages.&nbsp; But once these are done, using <tt>HTML</tt> is very 
easy.</p>
<h2>Check all <a href="Determining_ionized_sites.html">charged sites</a></h2>
<p>Proteins can have a large number of charged sites.&nbsp; These can be divided 
into two groups, salt bridges and all other charged sites.&nbsp; This check 
should be done at least twice.&nbsp; The first time it should be done is after 
the 1SCF calculation. To check for errors in ionization, start by looking at the 
output file from the <a href="Running_a_1SCF_calculation.html">1SCF calculation</a>. 
Later on, when the geometry is optimized and before any research work is 
started, the check should be run again. There are two lists in the output that 
are relevant, these are headed:</p><pre> Ion PDB Label Charge Distance PDB label for Salt Bridge Charge</pre> 
and <pre> Salt Bridges Found (Up to 8.0 Angstroms)</pre>
<p dir="ltr">All ionized sites identified by the Lewis structure are shown in the first list 
but only the salt-bridges are shown in the second list. In the second list the atomic charges are calculated from the 
electron density.</p>
