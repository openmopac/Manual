<tt>MINI</tt></h1>
When very large molecules such as enzymes are modeled, the output can become 
very large.&nbsp; To reduce this, use <tt>MINI</tt>.&nbsp; When <tt>MINI</tt> is 
present, only atoms whose coordinates are flagged with a "2" will be printed.&nbsp; 
During a run, atoms flagged with a "2" will be handled as if they were 
flagged with a "1".&nbsp; That is, the flag "2" will indicate an atom that is 
marked for optimization. For reaction paths, the reaction coordinate is normally "-1", if&nbsp; <tt>MINI</tt> 
is present then the reaction coordinate can be "-1" or "-2" ("-2" is obviously 
more likely). Although <tt>MINI</tt> works with all types of calculation, the main use 
would be for calculations that involve reaction paths and IRC paths.&nbsp;<p>
<tt>MINI</tt> 
is also useful when animations are involved, for example mapping out a reaction 
path or following an IRC or DRC.&nbsp;&nbsp; If <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> is 
present, then a HTML document will be created that can be run using Firefox.&nbsp; If <tt><a href="graph.html">GRAPHF</a> </tt>is present in runs that 
produce animations then a file, &lt;file&gt;.xyz, will be generated.&nbsp; This can 
be visualized using Jmol.</p>
<p>When <tt>MINI</tt> and <tt><a href="ts.html">TS</a></tt> are both present, a 
transition state optimization calculation is run, and only atoms that are 
flagged with the symbol "2" will be 
printed; their positions will be changed during the optimization run. All nearby atoms that are to be moved during the optimization should be flagged with a 
"1", these atoms will not be printed.&nbsp; More distant atoms should be flagged with "0" to 
indicate that their positions are fixed (frozen); they will not be printed.</p>
<p><tt>MINI</tt> and <a href="force.html"><tt>FORCETS</tt></a> can be used with 
internal or Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; There are two ways to run <tt>MINI</tt> 
- <tt>FORCETS</tt> jobs:</p>
<p>(A) Running <tt>MINI</tt> and <tt>FORCETS</tt> in one job; this is not 
recommended for large systems. Use keywords <tt>HTML FORCETS <a href="irc.html">IRC</a> MINI</tt>&nbsp; 
plus others, to suit.&nbsp; Set optimization flags to "2" for the atoms to be 
used in <tt>FORCETS</tt>, and to "0" for all other atoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(B) Running <tt>MINI</tt> and <tt>FORCETS</tt> in two jobs; this is the 
recommended method for large systems.&nbsp; In the first job, use keywords <tt>
FORCETS <a href="isotope.html">ISOTOPE</a></tt> 
plus any others needed.&nbsp; Set optimization flags to "1" for the atoms to be 
used in <tt>FORCETS</tt>, and to "0" for all other atoms.&nbsp; In a second job, use 
keywords <tt>HTML FORCETS IRC MINI <a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></tt> plus others to suit. Use the 
same geometry plus flags as in the first job.&nbsp; To add an atom to the set of 
atoms printed, change its optimization flags from "0" to "2".&nbsp; This gives 
increased flexibility in that the atoms used in the <tt>FORCETS</tt> calculation need to 
be as few as possible, because the <tt>FORCETS</tt> calculation is CPU intensive, but 
increasing the number of atoms printed in the <tt>IRC</tt> calculation only affects the 
files generated.</p>
<p>When <tt>MINI</tt> and <tt><a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a></tt> are both present 
then a file, &lt;file&gt;.xyz, will 
be generated.</p>
<p> <tt>MINI</tt> is useful when locating transition states, in <tt>FORCETS</tt> 
calculations, in following reaction paths, and in <a href="irc.html"><tt>IRC</tt></a> 
and <a href="drc.html"><tt>DRC</tt></a> trajectories.</p>
<p> If <tt><a href="pdbout.html">PDBOUT</a></tt> is present, a PDB file will also be written; this file will be 
complete.&nbsp; So if a complete geometry is wanted, as well as the minimized 
geometry, then add <tt>PDBOUT</tt>.&nbsp; </p>
