<h1 class="auto-style5">Editing the Starting 
	Model to make small changes</h1>
<p class="auto-style6">When a small change needs to be made to a protein, for 
example to convert a carboxylic acid or carboxylate anion into an amide group, 
one way to proceed is as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style6">Start with the best geometry available, here the Starting 
Model should be used.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">The geometry should be in PDB form, and all atoms in each 
residue should be contiguous.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that they are not, run <a href="reseq.html">
<tt>RESEQ</tt></a> <a href="pdbout.html"><tt>PDBOUT</tt></a> to make them contiguous.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">Using an editor, e.g., notepad or vi, edit the PDB file 
to replace the old atom label with the new atom label. If, as is likely,&nbsp;the 
number or positions of the hydrogen atoms are now incorrect, use keyword
<a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a> if a hydrogen atom is to be added.&nbsp; If a hydrogen atom 
needs to be deleted, delete it by editing the PDB file.&nbsp; Keyword <tt>SITE</tt> could 
be used for deleting a hydrogen atom, but it's faster to simply edit it out.</p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span class="auto-style7"><strong>Notes</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style6">Working with the data in MOPAC format is just as easy as 
using PDB format, but looking at the geometries using a GUI is more difficult, 
so whenever possible 
use the PDB format.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">Even small changes, such as converting a -COOH or -COO(-) 
into -CONH2, involve a change in empirical formula and possibly net charge.&nbsp; 
This means that comparison of heats of formation of the modified structure with 
that of the original structure cannot be done.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">Finally, and most important: By only modifying one 
residue in the original geometry, no issues of ionization are involved; the 
original ionization states are preserved, except in the edited residue.</p>
