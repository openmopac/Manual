<tt>LOCATE-TS, LOCATE-TS(C:[n.nn[,n.nn[,n.nn...]]][;Set:m])<a name="let"></a></tt></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This function was developed specifically for locating transition states in 
enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but can be used for more general reactions.</p>
<p>The objective of <tt>LOCATE-TS </tt>is 
to locate and refine a transition state joining two stationary points in a reaction.&nbsp; These points are 
more commonly referred to as reactants and products, but for 
convenience in this description these geometries will be referred to as <strong>
A</strong> and 
<strong>B</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>A</strong> and 
<strong>B</strong> are used because during the calculation the geometries will 
be modified as they move towards each other, and would therefore no longer be 
stationary points.&nbsp; In <tt>LOCATE-TS, </tt>the geometry optimization is performed on both <strong>A</strong> 
and <strong>B</strong> simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp; For small systems consider using <a href="saddle.html"><tt>SADDLE</tt></a>.</p>
<p>The function being optimized is:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&Delta;H<sub>f</sub>' = &Delta;H<sub>f<strong>A</strong></sub> + &Delta;H<sub>f<strong>B</strong></sub> 
+c&Sigma;<sub>i</sub>(X<sub><strong>A</strong></sub><sup>i</sup> - X<sub><strong>B</strong></sub><sup>i</sup>)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="auto-style2">where &Delta;H<sub>f<strong>A</strong></sub> and &Delta;H<sub>f<strong>B</strong></sub>&nbsp; are the 
calculated heats of formation of <strong>A</strong> 
and <strong>B</strong>, respectively. "c" 
is a constant, in kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup>, and X<sub><strong>A</strong></sub><sup>i</sup> 
and X<sub><strong>B</strong></sub><sup>i</sup> are the coordinates of atom "i" in the <strong>A</strong> 
and <strong>B</strong>, respectively.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style2">When it is necessary to keep some atoms fixed, atoms in 
the data-set that are not flagged for optimization can be frozen by adding 
keyword <tt><a href="nooptx.html">NOOPT</a></TT>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Advice on using<tt> LOCATE-TS</tt></h2>
<p>Both geometries used must be as good as possible: They should be stationary 
points on the Potential Energy Surface (PES); they should include PDB data, 
either by using a PDB file or, more commonly, by using the normal MOPAC data-set 
format, and having the atoms labeled with PDB data.</p>
<p>It is helpful to have all the files involved located in the same folder.&nbsp; Although not essential, 
this will make the job 
of defining <tt>GEO_DAT </tt>and <tt>GEO_REF</tt> easier.</p>
<p>Because of the large probability of introducing errors into the data sets, 
instead of preparing specific data-sets it is safer to define the geometries 
to be used using <a href="geo_dat.html"><tt>GEO_DAT</tt></a> and <a href="geo_ref.html">
<tt>GEO_REF</tt></a>, and having 
these keywords point to ARC files.&nbsp; This results in a very small data set.&nbsp; 
For example, if the reactant geometry is in Step_1.arc and the product geometry 
is in Step_2.arc, the data set would be as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>Example of a complete data set for LOCATE-TS</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><strong>LOCATE-TS GEO_DAT="Step_1.arc" 
GEO_REF="Step_2.arc" EPS=78.4 
</strong> </p>
<p><tt><a href="eps.html">EPS</a></tt> is specified here, because using implicit 
solvation gives a more realistic model for biochemical reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keyword&nbsp; <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> 
causes the <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> function to be used, so 
there is no need to add 
keyword <tt>MOZYME</tt>, if it is supplied, it will be ignored.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style7"><strong>WARNING: </strong></span><strong>The quality of the 
transition state geometry is normally not very good.&nbsp; It's good enough to 
allow tests, such as </strong> <a href="force.html"><tt><strong>FORCE</strong></tt></a><strong> and inspection using a GUI, 
to be run to verify that it is, in fact, a transition state, but the heat of 
formation is likely to be in error because the geometry is not fully optimized. 
Unless corrected, this fault would compromise any comparison of transition-state 
heats of formation with heats of formation of ground-state systems.&nbsp; This 
correction is not done automatically - finding transition state geometries 
requires a lot of CPU time, and, often at the start of a project, many attempts will fail.&nbsp; 
So rather than perform a lengthy geometry optimization on a faulty transition 
state, a "quick and dirty" job is done.&nbsp; Once a good transition state is 
found, it can then be refined as follows:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Reactions involving bond making and bond breaking, i.e., chemical 
reactions</strong></h3>
<p>Geometries resulting from transition state refinement could be regarded as 
being composed of two sets: those atoms directly involved in the reaction, and 
all other atoms. As a result of the refinement the positions of all atoms in the 
first set, typically 7 or fewer, would be highly optimized. By freezing the 
positions of these atoms and then running the second geometry optimization 
procedure, the geometry of the entire transition-state system could be optimized 
to the same precision as that used for stable intermediates. In test 
calculations, a gradient minimization was performed using the atoms in the first 
set to verify that this operation did not introduce spurious forces; in all 
cases, this resulted in only insignificant changes in the heat of formation and 
in the positions of the atoms.&nbsp; Use <a href="invert.html"><tt>INVERT</tt></a> to 
quickly switch optimization flags.</p>
<p>If keyword <tt><a href="let.html">LET</a></tt> is present, docking of the two systems will not be performed 
in a <tt> LOCATE-TS</tt> job.&nbsp; This is useful in small systems if the atoms are in 
the same order in the reactants and products.&nbsp; Avoid using <tt>LET </tt>in large 
systems, instead identify any mis-matches and edit the reactants or product 
labels to correct the error.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3><strong>Reactions involving only conformational changes</strong></h3>
<p>Transition states between different conformers can be located using <tt> LOCATE-TS</tt>. 
As with chemical reactions, conformational changes involve "reactants" and 
"products," but no bonds are made or broken.&nbsp; Once the approximate 
transition state is located, it can be refined using <a href="ts.html"><tt>TS</tt></a> or 
other transition-state refinement method. Unlike the refinement when chemical 
reactions are modeled, <tt>INVERT</tt> cannot be used because no bonds are made 
or broken.</p>
<h2>Worked exercise in locating a transition state.</h2>
<p>A complete enzyme catalyzed mechanism for the hydrolysis of a peptide bond is 
given in <a href="Chymotrypsin_mechanism.html">Chymotrypsin Mechanism</a>.&nbsp; 
The worked exercise involves determining the transition state for the first 
reaction step.&nbsp; Except for Step 3 =&gt; Step 4, the other steps are similar.
</p>
<p>Download <a href="Step_1.arc"><strong>Step_1.arc</strong></a> and <strong>
<a href="Step_2.arc">Step_2.arc</a></strong> and store them in a new folder.&nbsp; 
In the same folder, create a text file, Step_1_2_Transition_State.mop.&nbsp; 
Edit this file to add the text in the above example.&nbsp; Run the job using 
MOPAC.&nbsp; It should run for about one day.&nbsp; If an ARC file is generated, 
the test was successful.&nbsp; If it was not generated, please contact me at
<a href="mailto:openmopac@gmail.com">openmopac@gmail.com</a>, and send me 
the data set and output files.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How&nbsp; LOCATE-TS works</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">The process that LOCATE-TS uses is as follows: The 
reference data set geometry, defined using <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a>, 
is rotated and translated to put it into the best overlap with the geometry from 
the input data set.&nbsp; At this point, the two geometries are likely to be 
quite different.&nbsp; This difference can be expressed as a distance, defined 
as the square root of the sum in the above equation.&nbsp; Typical distances in 
enzyme chemistry are 
in the order of 50 - 300&Aring;.&nbsp; Geometry optimization is then started, using a small 
value for "c," by default this is 3 kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; 
The first step consists of solving the SCF equations using the
<a href="mozyme.html">
<tt>MOZYME</tt></a> technique.&nbsp; (There is no need to specify
<tt>MOZYME</tt>, the presence of <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> implies <tt>MOZYME</tt>.)&nbsp; All subsequent steps 
use the wavefunction from this initial SCF calculation, and the pull exerted by 
the "c" term. This causes the two geometries to move towards each other without 
imposing a large stress. During this process, the distance will typically drop 
by a large amount - the two geometries can be regarded as moving across an 
almost level plane until they stop near the bottom of the activation barrier.&nbsp; 
The value of "c" is then increased; the new default value is <nobr>30 kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup></nobr>.&nbsp; 
This large pull then moves <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> up the 
barrier to near to the transition state.&nbsp; As with the previous step, the 
first point involves solving the SCF equations, and all subsequent points use 
the frozen wavefunction.&nbsp; This optimization is repeated a few times using 
the same value of "c" to ensure that the wavefunction is sufficiently relaxed.&nbsp; 
When the optimization is finished the geometries of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are almost the same, with 
one on each side of the transition state. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">An estimate of the transition state geometry, <strong>C</strong>,&nbsp; 
is obtained by averaging the two geometries.&nbsp; The next few steps involve a 
pair of operations, each pair being repeated a small number of times, typically 
two to five times.&nbsp; The first of this pair of operations 
involves geometry optimization of <strong>C</strong>, while holding fixed all 
atoms involved in bond making or bond breaking, i.e. optimizing the positions of all atoms except those in 
the active site.&nbsp; The second step involves transition state location, i.e., 
gradient minimization, but this time using only the atoms in the active site.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Options for LOCATE-TS</h2>
<h3 class="auto-style6"> <tt><strong>LOCATE-TS</strong></tt></h3>
<p class="auto-style6"><tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> can be used on its own, i.e., without 
any of the terms in the square brackets; if that is done, then 
the default optimization procedure is used, and output is small.&nbsp; The default optimization can 
be reproduced using <tt>LOCATE-TS(C:3,30,30,30;SET:1)</tt></p>
<p class="auto-style6">About half the time the default <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> does 
not finish correctly. Almost always the first big step, moving the reactants and 
products up the reaction barrier, runs correctly, and most of the time when 
failures occur they occur in the refinement of the transition state. Because of 
this behavior, at the end of the first big step three data sets are generated 
that can then be used in attempting to refine the transition stae.&nbsp; These 
data sets have the names <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_first.mop</strong>,&nbsp;
<strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_second.mop</strong>, 
and&nbsp; <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_average.mop</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_first.mop</strong> is the 
final geometry generated from the original data set (the reactant) or by the 
file defined by <tt>GEO_DAT</tt>.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_second.mop</strong> is the final 
geometry from <tt>GEO_REF</tt>. <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_first.mop</strong> and 
<strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_second.mop</strong> 
are thus the geometries on each side of the transition state, near the top of 
the reaction barrier.&nbsp; An approximation to the transition state geometry is 
the average of these two structures, this is given in <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_average.mop</strong>.&nbsp; 
The final value of "c" used is indicated by the text "<strong>30p0</strong>"&nbsp; This specific 
case represents a value of "c" of <nobr>30.0 kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup></nobr>.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style6"><tt><strong>LOCATE-TS(C:30,30,30,40,40;SET:1)</strong></tt></h3>
<p class="auto-style6">If <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> does not finish correctly, examine 
the structures on each side of the transition state.&nbsp; If these look 
correct, then try to refine them by using this option.&nbsp; Do not start with a 
constraint lower than the last value used in the previous run - if the 
constraint is lowered, the two systems will move away from the transition state.&nbsp; 
Using options of the type shown here increases the possibility that the 
refinement would work correctly because the refinement would be started with a 
geometry that was nearer to the transition state. </p>
<p class="auto-style6">If the structures on each side of the transition state do 
not look correct, then start over with a more cautious set of constraints.&nbsp; An example of 
such a cautious set would be <tt>LOCATE-TS(C:1,3,10,20,25,25;SET:1)</tt> This 
starts the procedure with a small penalty function, <nobr>1.0 kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup></nobr> 
followed, in order, by increasing biases, until a penalty of <nobr>25.0 kcal/mol/&Aring;ngstrom<sup>2</sup></nobr>
is used. The transition state would then be refined using Set 1, i.e., all atoms 
involved in bond making or bond breaking.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">When this form of the keyword is used, the output will be 
larger, and intermediate files generated; these files can then be used in 
locating the transition state manually.&nbsp; The number of constraints used can be decreased to zero or 
increased up to 20.&nbsp; Two main options for the size of the active site are provided. 
<tt>SET:1</tt> consists of only those atoms involved in bond making or bond 
breaking and 
<tt>SET:2</tt> which consists of <tt>SET:1</tt> plus nearest neighbors.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style6"><tt><strong>
LOCATE-TS(C:0.001,0.002,0.005,0.010,0.020,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200) 
NOSWAP</strong></tt></h3>
<p class="auto-style6">Used when reactions involving conformational changes are 
being modeled.&nbsp; Because no bonds 
are made or broken, ";SET:x" is not used.&nbsp; Because conformational changes 
typically involve large geometric changes the starting bias is very small. For 
the same reason, keyword <a href="noswap.html"><tt>NOSWAP</tt></a> is also used.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style6"> <tt><strong>LOCATE-TS(C:;SET:1)</strong></tt></h3>
<p class="auto-style6">The two data sets used by&nbsp; <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> are 
passed directly, i.e., without modification, to the transition state refinement 
operation. If the two geometries are near to the transition state, there is an 
increased probability that the process for recognizing bond-breaking and bond 
making operation will not work correctly.&nbsp; To avoid problems with this 
operation, use the next option, <em>vis</em> <tt><strong>LOCATE-TS(SET:1).</strong></tt></p>
<h3 class="auto-style6"> <tt><strong>LOCATE-TS(SET:1)</strong></tt></h3>
<p class="auto-style6">This option uses only one data-set, usually the one 
generated by an earlier run, e.g., <strong>&lt;name&gt;_30p0_average.mop.&nbsp;
</strong>Carefully define the atoms 
involved in bond-breaking and bond-making by setting their 
optimization flags set to "1", all other optimization flags being set to zero. 
When this option is used the option for "<tt>SET:2</tt>" is meaningless.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> was developed and optimized for 
use with enzymes.&nbsp; It can be used for other species, but the probability of 
success is lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="auto-style8">When Things Go Wrong</h2>
<p>Quite often, particularly with difficult reactions, e.g., hydride, H<sup>-</sup>, 
migration, the gradient minimizer might fail to produce a valid geometry. When 
this happens, have a look at the geometry in "&lt;filename&gt; Loop1.mop"&nbsp; If it 
looks reasonable, proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Edit the set of keywords to convert it into a normal transition-state 
optimization calculation.&nbsp; This will involve deleting the keywords <tt>GEO_REF </tt> 
and <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt>, and adding the keywords <tt>MOZYME</tt>, <tt>TS</tt>, <tt>GNORM=3</tt>.&nbsp; 
The geometry already has the flags set for the atoms involved in the reaction.&nbsp; 
Run that job.&nbsp; It will likely fail, but the resulting geometry will likely 
be nearer to the transition state, and if that geometry is run, the gradient 
minimization will likely work.&nbsp; Well, it did work on several difficult 
transition states.</p>
<p>At this point, a reasonable question is, why doesn't MOPAC do this itself.&nbsp; 
The short answer is "Yes, it should."&nbsp; The longer answer is, someone has to 
write the software to do this.&nbsp; An even longer answer is, there should be 
better gradient minimizers.&nbsp; Until work on this is done, the process just 
described is the best that exists in MOPAC.</p>
<p>If <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> fails to produce a reasonable transition state, it is 
possible to get better geometries for the reactants and products, i.e., 
geometries on each side of the transition state.&nbsp; In addition, the average 
of these geometries might be a useful approximation to the transition state.&nbsp; 
When <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> is run it produces a set of data-set files for each 
value of bias used, one for the reactants, one for the products, and one for the 
average.&nbsp; These can be identified by the value of the bias and the words 
"first", "second", and "average" in the the file-names.&nbsp; If the transition 
state geometry was correct, then delete these intermediate geometries.&nbsp; If 
it is not correct, look at these files to see if anything useful can be found.&nbsp; 
In particular, look for intermediate geometries that are on the slope of the 
activation barrier.&nbsp; These might be useful in restarting the transition 
state location.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TS, SIGMA, NLLSQ</h3>
<p>Three different gradient optimization methods can be used: Baker's 
Eigenfollowing method <a href="ts.html"><tt>TS</tt></a>, the McIver-Komornicki gradient 
minimization method <a href="sigma.html"><tt>SIGMA</tt></a>, and Bartel's
<a href="nllsq.html"><tt>NLLSQ</tt></a>. If one of these keywords is present, that method 
will be used. Otherwise, Baker's Eigenfollowing method will be used by default.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Complete worked examples of <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt></h3>
<p><tt>LOCATE-TS </tt> was used 
to locate transition states in the <a href="Chymotrypsin_mechanism.html">
chymotrypsin mechanism</a>.&nbsp; To reproduce this mechanism, download the ARC 
files for the intermediates (Step 1 to Step 6), and use the <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> keyword in 
the transition state stationary point arc files.</p>
<p>A simple worked example of a conformational change is
