<p align="left">Use of a <a href="grid_calc.html">GRID </a>to generate the
transition state:<img align="right" border="0" height="173" src="c2h2_c4.gif" width="173"/></p>
<p align="left">The obvious way to find the transition state
is to generate the potential energy surface map in which one direction
represented
the C<sub>1</sub> -- CO distance and the other represented theC<sub>1</sub> --
CO distance.&nbsp; In this map, the C - C distances are varied from 1.4 to 2.4
A.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting map does, indeed, contain a good approximation to
the transition state, indicated by the small grey ball in the picture.&nbsp; The
spikes in the graphic were caused by hysteresis; these can be eliminated by
adding <a href="smooth.html"><tt>SMOOTH</tt></a> to the keywords, as shown in the second
PES figure.&nbsp; At all times, the system is planar, and at large and very
small C -- C distances, it is C2v.&nbsp; At intermediate distances, the C=O is
in almost a straight line with the shorter C -- C bond.&nbsp; When the two C --
C bonds are equal in length, the C=O is tilted either to one side or the other.&nbsp;
If it is tilted one way and the C -- C bonds become unequal, the system will
become either the lowest energy conformer, or it will become the higher energy
conformer. Distortion out-of-plane involves an increase in energy, and returning
to C2v also involves an increase in energy.&nbsp; Therefore there is a barrier
between the two conformers.&nbsp; This reaches an extreme in the region of the
yellow spikes near the center of the picture.&nbsp;<img align="right" border="0" height="166" src="c2h2_c5.gif" width="201"/> The reason for the
complicated, and obviously incorrect structure, is that the map is asked to
represent two contradictory quantities: the lowest energy structure for a given
pair of C -- C distances, and the conformer nearest to the previous point.&nbsp;
If the latter requirement were removed, then the PES would, indeed be smooth,
but with a sharp ridge in the region where the two C -- C distances are equal.&nbsp;
This would be the point at which the C=O "flips" from one side to the other.</p>
