Dear Nick,



Please download 



http://openmopac.net/makpol.zip



The instructions for using the program are in makpol.cmd

Please keep me informed of your progress with Makpol, and don't hesitate to ask for help.  If you can improve it, great.



I'm very excited at the thought of MOPAC being able to "read" a cif file.  Just now I use the following procedure:



1. Use Mercury to make a 2 by 2 by 2 lattice of unit cells in PDB format.

2. Use a GUI to identify an atom I like (an atom that's easy to locate in each unit cell).

3. Make that atom atom 1.

4. Identify the equivalent three atoms in unit cells (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0).

5. Re-name these atoms "Tv"

6. Make up a MOPAC-style data set using this structure. Call this make_test.dat

7. Add "MERS=(1,1,1)" to the keyword line.

8. Run Makpol using "makpol test" (note: "make_" and ".dat" are missing)

9. Look at the resuling MOPAC data set.  If any Tv is less than ~7 A, increase the corresponding value in mers.  Thus in the .cmd, there are the lines:

ECHO :  Tv   -0.879  1   0.000  1   5.066  1  
ECHO :  Tv    0.000  1   6.982  1   0.000  1  
ECHO :  Tv    7.617  1   0.000  1   0.000  1  



The first Tv is ~5.1 A, so in order to increase it, the corresponding value in MERS must be increased to 2, e.g. MERS=(2,X,X)

The second Tv is 6.982, so its value in MERS must be increased (MERS=(X,2,X))

The third Tv is big enough for an organic system like aspartic acid, so its MERS is MERS=(X,X,1).



Makpol is re-run with the new values of MERS, and the resulting data set can be used in MOPAC2007 directly.



Although I've used makpol for 10+ years, it has not been distributed.  So my brief instructions here might be unclear.  If that's the case, please let me know, and I'll try to clarify them.  A secondary objective is to set up a set of instructions for general use.



Best wishes,



Jimmy Stewart
