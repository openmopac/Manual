<h1 align="center">Specifying a temperature in a DRC </h1>
<p align="left">The behavior of a system at a specified temperature can be 
modeled by use of <tt><a href="kinetic.html">KINETIC</a></tt>.&nbsp; This 
keyword allows extra kinetic energy to be added to the system.&nbsp; In order to 
determine how much extra energy to add, an understanding of the issues involved 
is essential.</p>
<h2 align="left">Energy issues involved in a dynamic system</h2>
<p align="left">The total energy of a system can be expressed as three sums:</p>
<p align="left">(A) The heat of formation of the system, <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f0</sub>.&nbsp; 
This is an irreducible minimum, and represents the energy of the system at 
equilibrium.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The potential energy of the system.&nbsp; This is the heat 
of formation of the system with its current geometry, <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub>, 
minus <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f0</sub>. It represents the energy of 
distortion from the equilibrium geometry.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The kinetic energy of the system.&nbsp; This is the sum of 
the vibrational energies of motion of all the atoms in the system.</p>
<p align="left">Energy term (A) is a constant, regardless of temperature. Energy 
terms (B) plus (C) represent the internal energy (enthalpy), U, of the system.&nbsp; 
At zero Kelvin, U is zero.&nbsp;At any other temperature, T, the enthalpy 
represents the integral of the heat capacity from zero to T. In a DRC 
calculation, any desired temperature can be specified by defining the 
associated internal energy.&nbsp; The internal energy can be calculated using <tt>
<a href="thermo00.html">THERMO</a></tt>, and specifying the temperature to be 
used.&nbsp; In the output of a <tt>THERMO</tt> calculation, the enthalpy needed 
is given at the intersection of <tt>ENTHALPY</tt> and <tt>VIB</tt>.&nbsp; In the 
following example, this would be 578.5 cal/mol, or 0.578 kcal/mol. </p>

<p align="left">To set up a run at a given temperature, the&nbsp; <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f </sub>
of the optimized system is needed.&nbsp; Calculate this first, then do a <tt>THERMO</tt> 
calculation to get the enthalpy at the desired temperature.&nbsp; The next step 
might be unexpected.&nbsp; Distort the geometry of the system slightly, and 
re-calculate the heat of formation at the distorted geometry.&nbsp; Make sure 
that it has increased by at least 0.2 kcal/mol, and preferably by a large 
fraction of the enthalpy. A non-equilibrium starting geometry is needed in a DRC 
calculation because otherwise the atoms would not be moving, and adding in 
excess kinetic energy would not be possible (You can't make the atoms move 
faster if they were not moving originally).</p>
<p align="left">Work out how much extra kinetic energy would need to be added to 
equal the vibrational enthalpy at the desired temperature. </p>
<p align="left">Let the calculated equilibrium heat of formation be -100.000 
kcal/mol.<br/>
Let the desired internal vibrational energy be 0.578 kcal/mol.<br/>
Let the heat of formation of the distorted geometry be -99.500 kcal/mol.</p>
<p align="left">Then the extra kinetic energy needed would be 0.078 kcal/mol.</p>
<p align="left">Set up the DRC calculation using the distorted geometry and <tt>KINETIC=0.078</tt>.&nbsp; 
Run this system.&nbsp; In the output, the starting heat of formation will be 
that of the distorted system, and the kinetic energy will be zero or almost 
zero.&nbsp; Over the next few femtoseconds, the heat of formation will become 
more negative, and the kinetic energy will rise.&nbsp; When it exceeds 0.2 
kcal/mol, the velocity vector for the system will be well defined, and the extra 
kinetic energy will then be added.&nbsp; This will temporarily confuse the 
predictor-corrector error reduction function, so errors in the calculation will 
rise for a while, but once they become small the total energy of the system 
(heat of formation of the current geometry plus kinetic energy) will be equal to <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f0</sub>&nbsp; 
plus the desired enthalpy.</p>
<p align="left">A legitimate question is, why do it this way, why not add the 
velocity vector "by hand"?&nbsp; The problem is, the kinetic energy must not 
include rotational or translational terms. Translational contributions to the 
enthalpy are irrelevant for a single molecule, and the rotational contributions 
are conserved, so they, too, can be ignored (or can they?), all that matters is 
the dynamics of the non-translating, non-rotating system.&nbsp; Defining a 
velocity vector that achieves this is definitely non-trivial.</p>
