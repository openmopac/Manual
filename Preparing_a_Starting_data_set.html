<p>(<a href="Modeling_proteins.html#Preparing">Modeling proteins</a>)</p>
<h1>Preparing a starting data set - adding and removing hydrogen atoms</h1>
<p>A very common step in the preparation of systems to be modeled is the 
addition and removal of hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; This operation is both important 
and difficult.&nbsp; Important because computational models must be as realistic 
as possible, and difficult because errors in hydrogenation are inevitable, some 
due to faults in the starting geometry, and others due to the default 
hydrogenation procedure not accounting for certain specific conditions, 
particularly those that occur in large ring complexes.&nbsp; Data-sets can be edited to add or 
delete hydrogen atoms "by hand," and graphics utilities exist that allow 
data-sets to be edited easily.&nbsp; An alternative when working with MOPAC is 
to use keywords instead.&nbsp; This allows  all the editing 
operations to a reference file, for example a PDB file from the
<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do" target="_parent">Protein Data 
Bank</a>, to be recorded in MOPAC data-sets, and if, as often happens, faults 
are found in the hydrogenation, 
these can easily be corrected by editing the appropriate data-set.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Because some proteins are extremely complicated, a useful strategy is to use 
several data-sets to convert a PDB file into a realistic MOPAC data-set.&nbsp; 
The individual data-sets can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p><u><b>Template procedure for hydrogenating proteins</b></u></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;1. Using keyword <a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt></a>, hydrogenate the PDB file.<br/>
&nbsp;2. Using keyword <a href="charges.html"><tt>CHARGES</tt></a>, identify all the ionized sites in the PDB file 
from Step 1.<br/>
&nbsp;3. Using keyword <a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a>, correct the errors in hydrogenation in the PDB file 
from Step 1.<br/>
&nbsp;4. Using keyword <tt>CHARGES</tt>, identify all the ionized sites in the PDB file 
from Step 3.<br/>
&nbsp;5. Using keyword <tt>SITE=(SALT)</tt>, add in all the default salt bridges.<br/>
&nbsp;6. Using keyword <tt>CHARGES</tt>, identify all the ionized sites in the PDB file 
from Step 5.<br/>
&nbsp;7. Using keywords <a href="nooptx.html"><tt>NOOPT</tt></a> and <a href="opth.html"><tt>OPT-H</tt></a>, optimize the positions of the hydrogen 
atoms in the PDB file from Step 5.</p>
<p>When faults are found in the ionized sites, the previous data-set should be 
edited to correct the faults, and re-run.&nbsp; Then the subsequent data-sets 
should be run.&nbsp; Eventually there should be no faults from hydrogenation.</p>
<p>At this point, a valid question would be, why doesn't the program hydrogenate 
the PDB file correctly?&nbsp; There are several reasons.&nbsp; First, some PDB 
files have geometric errors.&nbsp; An example can be illustrated using bacteriochlorophyll.&nbsp; There are seven chlorophyll molecules in this 
protein, in one of these, BCL-3, a ketone C=O distance is given as 1.303&nbsp;&Aring; 
instead of the expected 1.22&nbsp;&Aring;.&nbsp; This distortion caused the 
<tt>ADD-H</tt> procedure to assign a hydrogen atom to the oxygen, making it a hydroxy 
group instead of a ketone.&nbsp; Mistakes of this type are easy to make, and 
need to be corrected.&nbsp; Second, in other systems where there are two 
possible hydrogenation sites,  
<tt>ADD-H</tt> sometimes picks the wrong atom.&nbsp; This 
occurs most often in histidine.&nbsp; Third, because most 
PDB files do not discriminate between them, the choice of which oxygen atom in a 
carboxylate group should be the hydroxy and which the keto is difficult to 
decide a priori.&nbsp; Given all this, it is easier to perform a simple 
hydrogenation then correct the errors in a subsequent job.</p>
<p><u><b>Worked example of the hydrogenation of Bacteriochlorophyll (PDB: 4BCL)</b></u></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bacteriochlorophyll is a large, complicated protein, and can be 
used to illustrate the various problems in hydrogenation, and the different 
steps in resolving them. All the files used can be found in
<a href="Files%20used%20in%20Hydrogenation%20of%20Bacteriochlorophyll.zip">Files 
used in Hydrogenation of Bacteriochlorophyll .zip</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Names of the data-sets used in this example</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">1 ADD-H.mop<br/>
2 Calculate charges in ADD-H structure (first attempt).mop<br/>
2 Calculate charges in ADD-H structure.mop<br/>
3 Modify ADD-H structure.mop<br/>
4 Re-calculate charges.mop<br/>
5 Add salt bridges.mop<br/>
6 Re-calculate charges after adding salt bridges.mop<br/>
7 PM6-D3H4 Optimize positions of hydrogen atoms.mop<br/>
7 PM7 Optimize positions of hydrogen atoms.mop</p>
<p><b>Step 1:  
<tt>ADD-H</tt>: </b>This is the only easy step.&nbsp; The entire keyword line 
consists of:<br/>
<tt><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>="Bacteriochlorophyll (4BCL).ent" 
<a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a> <a href="html.html">HTML</a> ADD-H 
<a href="nocomments.html">NOCOMMENTS</a></tt></p>
<p>The purpose of each keyword used here is as follows:<br/>
<tt>GEO_DAT="Bacteriochlorophyll (4BCL).ent"</tt>: To minimize the 
risk of making a mistake, it is preferable to have the geometry in a separate 
file.&nbsp; So the original PDB file downloaded from the Protein Data Bank is 
stored in the file
"Bacteriochlorophyll (4BCL).ent"&nbsp; By using the alternative suffix ".ent" 
there is no danger that the original file could be accidentally modified by 
MOPAC.<br/>
<tt>OUTPUT: </tt>In this and all subsequent operations there is no need to look 
at the geometry in the ".out" file, so this minimizes the output, allowing only 
material of interest to be printed.<br/>
<tt>HTML: </tt>Errors in hydrogenation are most easily found using a GUI.&nbsp;
<tt>HTML</tt> generates a simple web-page that can be read using FireFox and 
JSmol also generates a PDB file.&nbsp; This file will then be used in the next 
step, see below.<br/>
<tt>NOCOMMENTS:</tt> In addition to the geometry the original PDB file contains 
a large amount of material that's not wanted here. None of that material is 
relevant to the work being described here, so all of it can be ignored from this 
point on.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: <tt>CHARGES:</tt></b> A first attempt to identify the charges resulting 
from Step 1 using keywords <tt>GEO_DAT="1 ADD-H.pdb" OUTPUT CHARGES HTML </tt>
resulted in a large number of spurious errors caused by missing covalent 
bonds. These errors were caused by the way metal atoms are treated in MOPAC; by 
default, for the purpose of generating Lewis structures, magnesium atoms are 
considered to be 100% ionic, i.e., not forming any covalent bonds.&nbsp; But an 
examination of the structure of chlorophyll, see Fig. 1, shows that a 
more realistic Lewis structure could be made by adding covalent bonds between 
each magnesium atom and two nitrogen atoms on opposite sides of the ring.&nbsp;
<img align="right" border="1" height="328" src="Chlorophyll%20ChemDraw.gif" width="896"/>These missing bonds were added using keyword <a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a>, using the 
multi-line keyword structure:</p>
<p>
<tt>GEO_DAT="1 ADD-H.pdb" OUTPUT CHARGES HTML ++<br/>
CVB=(++<br/>
"[BCL]1:B.MG":"[BCL]1:B.NB","[BCL]1:B.MG":"[BCL]1:B.ND",++<br/>
"[BCL]2:B.MG":"[BCL]2:B.NB","[BCL]2:B.MG":"[BCL]2:B.ND",++<br/>
"[BCL]3:B.MG":"[BCL]3:B.NB","[BCL]3:B.MG":"[BCL]3:B.ND",++<br/>

"[BCL]7:B.MG":"[BCL]7:B.NB","[BCL]7:B.MG":"[BCL]7:B.ND"++<br/>
)</tt></p>
<p>For convenience, atoms were identified by their Jmol name, not by their PDB 
name.&nbsp; Also, for ease of checking the CVB keyword for faults, each of the 
sets of Mg-N bonds was put on its own line.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: <tt>SITE:</tt></b> When the geometry in Step 2 was run the output showed 
that three cationic sites were predicted to exist.&nbsp; Because the purpose of 
the <tt>ADD-H</tt> 
operation is to add hydrogen atoms to satisfy valence requirements, if no errors 
occur then, with the exception of metal and isolated halogen atoms, all atoms 
should be neutral.&nbsp; So except for metals and halogen atoms the presence of ionized atoms 
normally indicates an error in 
hydrogenation.&nbsp; The ionized atoms are, in PDB notation:</p>
<p>HETATM 5564 C3B BCL 6<br/>
HETATM 5714 C4C BCL 4<br/>
HETATM 5864 C2D BCL 7<img align="right" border="1" height="355" src="Chlorophyll%20Fault%20at%20OBD%20on%20BCL-6%20ChemDraw.gif" width="289"/></p>
<p dir="ltr">Identifying the cause of these faults is often quite difficult.&nbsp; 
In the case of the first ionized site, "HETATM 5564 C3B BCL 6", the atom ionized 
is indicated at the top of the ring in Fig. 2 as "C<sup>+</sup>"&nbsp; A superficial examination of the 
conjugated &pi;-ring structure would suggest that this atom should either by 
hydrogenated or that there is a fault in the conjugation, but a careful comparison of 
the hydrogenation in Figs. 1 and 2 shows that the keto group an the bottom of 
Fig. 1 was incorrectly hydrogenated in Fig. 2.&nbsp; If the spurious hydrogen 
atom in the hydroxyl at the bottom of Fig. 2 is removed, the conjugation changes 
to be the same as that in Fig. 1 and carbon atom C3B is neutral, as expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, because of incorrect hydrogenation of atom C4A in BCL-4,&nbsp; 
the ring conjugation was incorrectly constructed, and "HETATM 5714 C4C BCL 4" 
was predicted to be ionized.&nbsp; When the hydrogen atom on C4A was removed, 
the correct conjugation formed, and C4C was correctly predicted to be neutral.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incorrect hydrogenation of atom C1C in BCL-7 resulted in ionization 
of the third ion, "HETATM 5864 C2D BCL 7".&nbsp; As with the other two ions, 
correct conjugation was achieved by deleting the incorrect hydrogen atom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A final examination of BCL-7 showed that a hydrogen atom had been 
incorrectly assigned to CHA and C1A. These and the other faulty hydrogen atoms 
were removed using the SITE command using the keywords:&nbsp; </p>
<tt>GEO_DAT="2 Calculate charges in ADD-H structure.pdb" OUTPUT HTML ++<br/>
SITE=(++<br/>
"[BCL]7:B.C1A"(-),++<br/>
"[BCL]7:B.CHA"(-),++<br/>
"[BCL]7:B.C1C"(-),++<br/>
"[BCL]4:B.C4A"(-),++<br/>
"[BCL]6:B.OBD"(-)++<br/>
)</tt>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Step 4: </b>Re-calculate <b> <tt>CHARGES:</tt></b> The results of Step 
3 were checked in the same way as Step 2 was used to check the results of Step 
1.&nbsp; The only difference being that instead of:</p>
<p>
<tt>GEO_DAT="1 ADD-H.pdb"</tt></p>
in Step 2, the keyword in Step 4 was changed to:<p>
<tt>GEO_DAT="3 Modify ADD-H structure.pdb"</tt></p>
<p>
<b>Step 5: </b>SITE=(SALT): Although salt bridges could be added in Step 1, errors in 
ionization could be more easily identified by delaying adding salt bridges until 
after all ionization errors were corrected.&nbsp; They are added at this point 
using the keywords:</p>
<p><tt>GEO_DAT="4 Re-calculate charges.pdb" OUTPUT HTML SITE=(SALT)</tt></p>
<p dir="ltr">On running this job 17 salt bridges are added.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Step 6: </b>Re-calculate <b> <tt>CHARGES</tt>: </b>This 
operation is similar to those in Steps 2 and 4.&nbsp; No errors were found, so 
the addition of hydrogen atoms could be considered to be correctly done.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Step 7:</b>&nbsp; OPT-H: Positions of all the hydrogen atoms are 
optimized using PM7 and using PM6-D3H4. The complete set of keywords used for 
the PM7 optimization is as follows:</p>

<p><tt>NOOPT</tt> is used because the input geometry is in PDB format, and,

<p><b>Examples where <tt>ADD-H</tt> produces systems that have ions</b></p>
<p>In 5UVJ four ions, a [Na]<sup>+</sup> and three [Cl]<sup>-</sup>, are 
present.&nbsp; These are ionized by default, resulting in a net charge of -2. 
This is not a fault.</p>
<p>In 5VPS there is a heterogroup, <a href="https://www3.rcsb.org/ligand/9G1">
9G1</a>, that contains a phosphanium (phosphonium).&nbsp; In 9G1, 
phosphorus forms single bonds with carbon atoms on four ligands. This results in 
the heterogroup having a net charge of +1, and thus the entire system has a net 
charge of +1.


This, also, is not a fault.</p>
<p>The PDB geometry of 5VPS does have a problem with 9G1, in that the C-C and C-N 
distances in the <a href="5VPS%20Add-H.html">piperidine ring</a>, click on 
"Specific Script" to see this, are very short, averaging 1.36 &Aring; instead 
of the <a href="9g1.html">expected</a> 1.51 &Aring;. Both the topology and the bond-lengths of 
9G1 in 
5VPS suggest that the hexagonal C<sub>5</sub>N ring should be a 4-(H)-pyridinium 
rather than a piperidine.&nbsp; This error in hydrogenation affects 
only C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>, and 
therefore does not introduce an error in the net charge, but should obviously be 
corrected by adding hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Errors of this 
type can also be corrected by use of the <tt>SITE</tt> keyword. </p>
<p>In 5ULI there is a heterogroup, <a href="https://www3.rcsb.org/ligand/0WD">
0WD</a>, that appears to contain a pyridinium ion - both C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> distances 
in the hexagonal C<sub>5</sub>N ring in 5ULI are about 1.40 &Aring;.&nbsp; This is nearer to 
the expected equivalent distances in pyridine, 1.37 &Aring;, than to that in a 
4-(H)-pyridine.&nbsp; In 0WD these distances should be about 1.49 - 1.50 &Aring;.&nbsp; Both the topology and the bond-lengths of 0WD in 
5ULI incorrectly suggest that 
the hexagonal C<sub>5</sub>N ring should be a pyridinium rather than a 1,4-dihydropyridine.&nbsp; 
This fault results in the ring having a net charge of +1.&nbsp; This type of error can only be 
detected by a careful examination of the published structure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once 
detected, correcting faults of this type by the use of keyword <tt>SITE</tt> is 
straightforward.</p>
