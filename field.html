<tt>FIELD=(<i>n</i>.<i>nn</i>,<i>m</i>.<i>mm</i>,<i>l</i>.<i>ll</i>)</tt>
</h1>
An external electric field of intensity <i>n</i>.<i>nn</i> volts/&Aring;ngstrom in the
<i>x</i>-direction, <i>m</i>.<i>mm</i> volts/&Aring;ngstrom in the <i>y</i>-direction,  and <i>l</i>.<i>ll</i>
volts/&Aring;ngstrom in the  <i>z</i>-direction is to be applied. The potential
arising from the field is zero at the origin of Cartesian space, i.e. <i>V</i>=0
at (<i>x</i>=0.0, <i>y</i>=0.0, <i>z</i>=0.0). At any other point, (<i>x,y</i>,<i>z)</i>,
the effect of
<tt>FIELD=(<i>n</i>.<i>nn</i>,<i>m</i>.<i>mm</i>,<i>l</i>.<i>ll</i>)</tt> is to
produce a potential equal to <i>V</i> = (<i>x.n.nn+y.m.mm+z.l.ll)</i> volts.<font face="Times New Roman"><tt> </tt>
</font>
<p>The effect on a molecule depends on the orientation of the molecule relative
to the field.&nbsp; Thus a hydrogen molecule would be polarized slightly by a
field parallel to the axis, but unaffected by a field perpendicular to the axis.&nbsp;
The polarization would be to produce a small positive charge on the hydrogen in
the (relatively) negative part of the field, and a small negative charge in the
positive part of the field.&nbsp; Any polarization would, of course, result in
the energy being lowered.</p>
<p>Because molecules have no net charge, the effect of an applied field is
independent of the location of the molecule.&nbsp; That is, if the field is
defined by FIELD=(1.0,0.0,0.0), the energy of a molecule centered at (+100,0,0)
would be the same as that at (-100,0,0) and the same as that at (0,0,0). Put
another way, the energy would be unaffected by motion in any direction,
including in the direction of the field.</p>
<p>The geometries of small molecules are only slightly affected by fields in the
order of 1 volt per Angstrom.&nbsp; This is because such a molecule is, of its
nature, small.&nbsp; The change in potential from one end of such a molecule to
the other would only be a few volts.&nbsp; Larger systems are affected much more
- a system that extends over 20A, say, would experience a potential change of 20
volts, if the field were along that axis.&nbsp; Macroscopic changes, such as
Zener breakdown, are the result of ions being accelerated by the field.&nbsp;
When these ions collide with neutral molecules, the molecules become ionized,
e.g. e<sup>-</sup> + N<sub>2</sub> =&gt; 2e<sup>-</sup> +N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an ion will be strongly affected by such a field. For
example, F<sup>-1</sup> at coordinates
1.00, 0.00, 0.00, would be stabilized by 1.0eV if a field were to be
applied by specifying <tt>FIELD=(1.0,0.0,0.0)</tt>. This is a direct consequence
of the net charge on the system interacting with the electric field: a charge of
+<i>x</i> at a point in space where the potential is <i>y</i> volts would have
an energy due to the potential of <i>x.y</i> eV.&nbsp; This is the origin of the
term electron-volt. </p>
<p>A
useful exercise is to monitor the behavior of an ion in an electric field, using
the <tt><a href="drc0.html">DRC</a></tt>:</p>
<p>Let the field be FIELD=(1,0,0), let the ion be F<sup>-</sup>,&nbsp; and have
a mass of 19 amu.&nbsp; The data set:</p>
<p>DRC LARGE T-PRIO=0.1 CHARGE=-1 FIELD=(1,0,0) GNORM=0 CYCLES=75 <br/>
Fluoride ion<br/>
In An Electric Field<br/>
F 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 </p>
<p>would be suitable here.&nbsp; After about 63fs, the ion would have moved
through 1 Angstrom, and the potential energy would have dropped by 23.06
kcal/mol.&nbsp; Conservation of energy requires that the kinetic energy equals
23.06 kcal/mol. Using E=(1/2)MV<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp; implies that the velocity is:</p>
<p>V = (2*4.184*10<sup>10</sup>*23.06/19) cm/sec = 3.19*10<sup>5</sup> cm/sec =
3.19 km/sec. </p>
<p>The 4.184*10<sup>10</sup> is the <a href="fun_con.html">conversion</a> from
kcal/mol to ergs per mol.&nbsp; <br/>
All other quantities, such as the  acceleration (5.06x10<sup>18</sup> cm/sec<sup>2
</sup>or 5.06x10<sup>13</sup> km/sec<sup>2</sup>), follow
simply.&nbsp; <br/>
Used in this way, the <tt><a href="drc0.html">DRC</a> </tt>is useful for
modeling ion implantation.</p>
