Locating transition state geometries using a reaction path defined with a dummy 
atom&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>
The Problem</h2>
<p class="auto-style6">
The transition state for many reactions can be easily obtained by simple mapping 
out the path resulting from steadily increasing or decreasing an interatomic 
distance.&nbsp; For example, the transition state for a hydrogen atom migrating 
from one carbon atom to the other in ethyl radical, CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>, 
can be generated by defining a "reaction path" consisting of the distance from 
the carbon atom of the CH<sub>2</sub> group to one of the hydrogen atoms on the 
CH<sub>3</sub> group, then steadily reducing this distance.&nbsp; At each point 
on this path, everything is optimized except, of course, the distance along the 
reaction path.&nbsp; As the distance is reduced, the energy will rise steadily 
until the transition state geometry is reached, then the energy will either 
start descending or it will descend suddenly.&nbsp; If the energy drops suddenly, it is 
always accompanied by a significant change in geometry.&nbsp; This unwanted 
effect can make locating the transition state a difficult task.</p>
<h2>
A solution - modifying the reaction path</h2>
<p class="auto-style6">
An alternative, ideally suited for motion involving a single atom, for example a 
hydrogen migration, is to re-define the reaction path in terms of the distances 
from the migrating atom to both the acceptor and donor atoms.&nbsp; An example for the hydrogen migration 
in the ethyl radical is shown in the figure.&nbsp; In this method, a dummy atom, 
shown here as an asterisk, *, is defined as being equidistant from the donor and 
acceptor atoms.&nbsp; This involved defining the position of the dummy atom 
using the distance, R<sub>*C<span class="auto-style7">1</span></sub>, to to the donor atom, and using the same distance in defining the position of the acceptor atom.&nbsp; The position of the moving 
atom, in this case a hydrogen atom, is then defined by a "reaction path" 
distance, R<sub>*H</sub>,&nbsp; from the dummy atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="auto-style6">
The position of the dummy atom, the distance to the acceptor atom, and the 
position of the migrating atom all need to be defined in internal coordinates.&nbsp; 
Because the acceptor atom distance is defined as an internal coordinate, its 
other two coordinates must also be in internal coordinates.&nbsp; The dummy 
atom's position has three degrees of freedom, its&nbsp;distance from the donor atom 
its angle and its dihedral.&nbsp; The acceptor atom has two degrees of freedom, 
its angle and dihedral; its distance from the dummy atom is symmetry defined, so 
that is not a degree of freedom.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">
The position of the migrating atom is defined by its distance from the dummy 
atom.&nbsp; This is the only variable it has.&nbsp; The migrating atom's angle 
is fixed at 180&deg;and involves the dummy atom and the donor atom. At this 
angle, the dihedral is meaningless, so this can be defined as 0&deg;and can be 
referenced to any nearby atom. This arrangement means that the migrating atom, 
the dummy atom, and the donor atom are always in a straight line. </p>
<p class="auto-style6">
In the reaction path, the adjustable quantity is the dummy atom - migrating atom 
distance.&nbsp; Given that, in most reactions the transition state geometry 
involves the migrating atom being between the donor and acceptor atoms, a 
suitable starting point for the reaction would be that R<sub>*H</sub> = -0.5 
&Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; If the path from there to R<sub>*H</sub> = 0.5 
&Aring;ngstroms were to be mapped out, it's likely that the transition state geometry 
would be seen in a plot of energy versus path.&nbsp; If it's not seen, then that 
same plot could be used in deciding whether to extend the starting point of the 
path or the ending point.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">

<h3>
Degrees of Freedom</h3>
<p class="auto-style6">
Using a dummy atom might appear to increase the number of geometric parameters, 
i.e., the number of degrees of freedom.&nbsp; 
In fact, this doesn't happen.&nbsp; Recall that the acceptor atom loses one 
degree of freedom, the distance, because that is defined to be the same as the 
donor - hydrogen distance. The migrating atom loses two degrees of 
freedom, its angle and dihedral, so the loss of these three degrees exactly 
compensates for the three new degrees introduced by the dummy atom.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">
Given that the number of degrees of freedom is correct, it might appear that 
there is still some limitation on the position of the moving atom.&nbsp; In 
practice, and provided the contained angle at both the donor and acceptor atoms 
is less than 90&deg;, a condition that is always true in practice, there are no 
limits on the position of the moving atom.&nbsp; It can even be on the straight 
line connecting the donor and acceptor atoms, at which point the dummy atom is 
also on the same line.</p>
