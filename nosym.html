<tt>NOSYM</tt> </h1>
<p>
By default, symmetry point-groups are
automatically assigned, and used in identifying the irreducible representations
of molecular orbitals, vibrations, and states, and in accelerating the
construction of the Hessian in FORCE calculations.</p>
<p>Sometimes a system almost has the symmetry of a point group higher than C<sub>1</sub>. Minor deviations from exact symmetry are allowed, but these
sometimes cause difficulties. If that happens, then the job will fail. To prevent this happening, the symmetry can be re-defined as C<sub>1</sub>. This effectively disables all the symmetry features, so some jobs, particularly <a href="force.html"><tt><font color="#0000ff"><u>FORCE</u></font></tt></a> calculations, will take longer to run. </p>
<p>Use <tt>NOSYM</tt> if there is any reason to suspect that the point-group symmetry features are causing problems. </p>
<p> A second type of symmetry can be used by specifying&nbsp; <tt><a href="symmetry.html"><u><font color="#0000ff">SYMMETRY</font></u></a></tt>.&nbsp;
This is distinct from the default of using the point-group of the system to
label irreducible representations and to accelerate <tt>FORCE</tt>
calculations. When <tt>SYMMETRY</tt> is used, the symmetry relations between
coordinates are defined by the user.&nbsp; These can be used for defining the
point-group of a molecule, for example the D<sub>6h</sub> of benzene, but no point-group
theory is used when <tt>SYMMETRY</tt> is specified.&nbsp;  </p>
