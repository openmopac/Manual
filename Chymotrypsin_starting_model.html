<h1 class="auto-style1">Worked example - preparing the Starting Model 
for Chymotrypsin</h1>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9">Chymotrypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of a peptide bond 
where there is a large hydrophobic residue attached to the carboxyl of the 
-CO-NH-.&nbsp; A good starting system for modeling is 8GCH, this can be 
downloaded from the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">PDB</a>.&nbsp; This system 
consists of chymotrypsin residues 1-11 and 16-245, a three-residue substrate GAW 
in the active site, four sulfate ions, and 346 water molecules.&nbsp; The entry 
8GCH has the formula C<sub>1111</sub></span>S<span class="auto-style9"><sub>16</sub></span>N<span class="auto-style9"><sub>300</sub></span>O<span class="auto-style9"><sub>704</sub>, 
or 2131 atoms.&nbsp; As with most protein structures in the PDB, the positions 
of hydrogen atoms were not reported. Several files that will be 
referred to in the following discussion can be 
</span>
<a href="8GCH_Chymotrypsin_files.zip"><span class="auto-style8">downloaded</span></a><span class="auto-style9">.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10">Constructing a starting model involves several steps and 
quite a lot of computer power, but the result is worth it.&nbsp; A good starting 
model is, as its name suggests, the starting point for a wide range of 
simulations.&nbsp; Great care should be used in building a starting model, to 
ensure that it is at a good energy minimum, that it is optimized, and that all 
the parts needed in subsequent operations are present.&nbsp; The example used 
here is for chymotrypsin, but the steps for other enzymes are similar.&nbsp; 
Don't rush the process - a lot of things can go wrong, and it is important to 
frequently check that everything is still on track.</p>

8GCH was copied to form a new file 8GCH_from_PDB.mop.&nbsp; This file was not 
edited, its contents were exactly the same as 8GCH.pdb.&nbsp; 8GCH_from_PDB.mop 
was then run using MOPAC, this resulted in four new files being created:</span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style9">8GCH_from_PDB.log -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of

point can be either 8GCH_from_PDB.arc or 8GCH_from_PDB.pdb.&nbsp; Starting with 
the PDB file is easier unless it is essential to refer to specific atoms.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9">If 
8GCH_from_PDB.arc is used, then the file is edited so that the keyword becomes:</span> "<a href="pdbout.html"><tt>PDBOUT</tt></a>
<a href="start_res.html"><tt>START_RES</tt></a>=<span class="auto-style9">(1E 16F 150G 250C 298F-300

8GCH_opt-H.mop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9">If 8GCH_from_PDB.pdb is used, then the file is edited to 
add three lines.&nbsp; The first line is</span> "<a href="pdbout.html"><tt>PDBOUT</tt></a>&nbsp; <tt><a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a> <a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=10</a>
<a href="pl.html">PL</a> <a href="nooptx.html">NOOPT</a> <a href="optx.html">OPT-H</a></tt>" 
<span class="auto-style9">The second and third lines can be blank or they can hold descriptive test.&nbsp; 
The resulting file saved as 8GCH_opt-H.mop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10">This file is then run.&nbsp; Keyword "PL" is useful in 
large systems like the ones being used here.&nbsp; A few seconds after the job 
starts, the output file will start to be written.&nbsp; If a tail is put on the 
output file, to display the end of the file as it's being written, then the PL 
keyword will cause the iterating heat of formation to be printed.&nbsp; This 
will typically be very large and positive, then after several iterations it 
will become large and negative.&nbsp; If it stays positive, kill the job and 
look for a fault in the data set.&nbsp; Optimizing the positions of the hydrogen 
atoms will take about 100 cycles, maybe 50, maybe 200, and will typically take 
several hours, so an overnight run is probably best.&nbsp; This job results 
in two new files:</p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style9">8GCH_opt-H.arc -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The usual archive file. This is interesting and will be useful in subsequent 
steps<br/>
8GCH_opt-H.out -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The usual output file.</span><br class="auto-style9"/><span class="auto-style9">8GCH_opt-H.pdb -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
data set in PDB format, containing the original geometry of the heavy atoms and 
the optimized geometry of the hydrogen atoms.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong><span class="auto-style9"><a name="Solvation">Solvation</a>: 
</span> </strong>
<span class="auto-style9">In general, solvation should always be used.&nbsp; It was not used in adding 
hydrogen atoms or in optimizing their positions, because the system is still too 
crude to justify using solvation.&nbsp; Solvation could have been used, but the 
only result would be to use extra CPU time, it would not improve the results 
significantly.&nbsp; For all subsequent work, however, solvation is essential.&nbsp; 
To add solvation, use</span> <a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="Use_of_SETUP">Use of SETUP</a></strong>: 
A very common source of user-error involves faulty or missing keywords.&nbsp; To 
reduce the probability of errors of this type, use</span> <a href="setup.html"><tt>SETUP</tt></a>
<span class="auto-style9">to define keywords that should be common to all calculations in a series. For 
this exercise, create a file "Chymotrypsin.txt" in the folder where the jobs are 
being run, and edit the file to insert one line: "EPS=78.4 MOZYME GNORM=10 
CHARGE=-1 PDBOUT"&nbsp; Save the file.&nbsp; In each data-set, add the keyword 
"SETUP=Chymotrypsin.txt" and delete the keywords EPS=78.4, MOZYME, GNORM=10 
CHARGE=-1, if present.&nbsp; If, at some future date, a different gradient 
criterion, e.g., 5, needs to be used, either edit Chymotrypsin.txt to replace 
GNORM=10 with GNORM=5, or add GNORM=5 to the keyword line.&nbsp; If the file 
Chymotrypsin needs to be in a different folder, then specify the exact path, 
e.g., "SETUP='C:/my files/Chymotrypsin.txt'"</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10"><strong>File names</strong>: It is very important that, 
when working with large systems, files are given names that indicate what they 
are.&nbsp; For small systems such as toluene, simple names, e.g., Toluene.mop, 
can be used, but when small changes are made in large systems it is very easy to 
get confused unless a systematic method is used for naming files.&nbsp; In the 
following discussion files are named as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9">The first four letters are 8GCH.&nbsp; This indicates 
that the system is based on the 8GCH structure and no heavy atoms have been added or 
deleted.</span><br class="auto-style9"/><span class="auto-style9">If "_make" is present, then the data set contains keyword</span> <a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a>.&nbsp;
<br/><span class="auto-style9">Each ionized site is then listed, using chain letters and residue numbers.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="Ionizing_some_sites:">Ionizing known

jobs in the next step.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style9">When the run is completed, two important files are 
produced: 8GCH_F16(+)_G194(-)_F102(-).pdb and 8GCH_F16(+)_G194(-)_F102(-).arc. 
The arc file shown that the &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style9"><sub>f</sub> of 
the unconstrained optimized structure is -47835 kcal/mol.&nbsp; This is the 
first &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style9"><sub>f</sub> that is meaningful - all 
previous heats of formation were on un-physical (not solvated or not optimized) 
structures.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>
<span class="auto-style9">
<a name="Testing_other_sites_for_Potential_Ionization">Testing other sites for 
Potential Ionization</a>: </span> </strong><span class="auto-style9">Whether specific sites are ionized or not can 
be investigated.&nbsp; Site F102 is the Asp of the catalytic triad, and is 
certainly ionized under all reasonable conditions.&nbsp; But what about other 
sites?&nbsp; Provided the total charge is unchanged various sites can be tested 
to see if they raise or lower the heat of formation.&nbsp; This involves forming 
or destroying salt bridges. If they lower it, the change is beneficial and the 
modification should be made, and <em>vice versa</em>. A reasonable assumption is 
that the state of ionization of one site would not affect that of another site 
significantly.&nbsp; Put another way, each potential salt bridge can be 
investigated without regard for any other ionization changes in the system.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style11">Salt bridge F16 - G194</span><span class="auto-style9">: 
This involves Ile16(+) and Asp194(-).&nbsp; In the previous step, the assumption 
was made that this salt bridge exists in chymotrypsin, but what if it should not 
exist?&nbsp; The files 8GCH_F102(-).* represent chymotrypsin with only Asp102 
ionized.&nbsp; From the optimized structure,&nbsp; 8GCH_F102(-).arc, the &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style9"><sub>f</sub> is -47803 kcal/mol. This is 
31 kcal/mol higher than when the salt bridge exists, therefore the conclusion 
can be made that the salt bridge Ile16(+) - Asp194(-) should exist, and that the 
strength of the salt bridge is ~31 kcal/mol.&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style11">Salt bridge E11 - F20</span><span class="auto-style9">: 
This involves Ser16(+) forming a salt-bridge with Glu194(-). Files: 
8GCH_E11(+)_F20(-)_F102(-).*&nbsp; The &Delta;</span>H<span class="auto-style9"><sub>f</sub> 
is -47800 kcal/mol, that is more positive than 8GCH_F102(-), therefore this salt

<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style4"><span class="auto-style9">Salt bridge HSO<sub>4</sub> -

Files: 8GCH_F16(+)_G194(-)_F102(-)_G154(+)_HSO4(-).* This system gave a &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
of -47855, 20 kcal/mol more negative than 8GCH_F16(+)_G194(-)_F102(-), therefore 
this salt bridge should exist.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style11">Salt bridge F36 -F63</span><span class="auto-style9">: 
This involves Lys36(+) and Ser63(-). At physiological pH, 7.3 - 7.4, lysine's 
side chain (pKa: 10.5) is normally ionized.&nbsp; To avoid changing the number 
of atoms, 4574, in the system, for this run the nearby serine is also ionized.&nbsp; 
After geometry 
optimization, the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
was -47857 kcal/mol, which is 22 kcal/mol more negative than 
8GCH_F16(+)_G194(-)_F102(-), therefore it seems that this salt bridge should 
exist. However, examination of Ser63 shows that it is neutral!&nbsp; Near to 
Ser63 is a structure [H<sub>3</sub></span>O<span class="auto-style9"><sub>2</sub></span>]<span class="auto-style9"><sup>-</sup>, this is strongly 
hydrogen bonded to the serine and to nearly water molecules. The interpretation 
is obvious: a solvated hydroxyl ion and a serine residue is more stable than a 
water molecule in solution and a serine anion residue.&nbsp; A lack of chemical 
knowledge can be disastrous!</span></p>

<strong>Comparison of PDB X-ray structure and the PM7 structure:</strong> At 
this point, it is interesting to compare the PM7 structure with 
the original X-ray structure from the PDB.&nbsp; If a comparison is made of the 
geometry of the X-ray structure after adding hydrogen atoms and ionizing Asp102 
with the fully optimized structure from&nbsp; 8GCH_F102(-), the RMS difference 
is 1.11 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; If only the backbone is compared, the RMS 
difference drops to 0.65 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; The difference is due mainly to 
motion of the water molecules.&nbsp; When the backbone structures of the 
original and optimized geometries are superimposed, the result is as shown in 
the adjacent figure.&nbsp; Another measure of difference is from the energy 
change in going from the hydrogenated X-ray structure (-43780 kcal/mol) to the 
optimized PM7 structure (-47803 kcal/mol).&nbsp; This difference, 4,023 kcal/mol, 
is obviously a large amount, and is due to errors in the original X-ray 
structure and errors in the computational model. A measure of the error in the 
original X-ray structure can be obtained by performing a constrained 
optimization, where the optimized structure is biased towards the original X-ray 
structure.&nbsp; This is shown in 8GCH_Geo_ref.*.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">
<strong><span class="auto-style9"><a name="Editing_the_Substrate">Editing</a> the Substrate:</span></strong><span class="auto-style9"> The 
substrate in 8GCH consists of the tripeptide       Gly250-Ala251-Trp252. In the 
PDB file, this system is described as "GAMMA-CHYMOTRYPSIN IS A COMPLEX OF 
ALPHA-CHYMOTRYPSIN WITH ITS OWN</span><br class="auto-style9"/>
<span class="auto-style9">TITLE 2 AUTOLYSIS PRODUCTS," so the substrate 
is a short section of chymotrypsin itself.&nbsp; Inspection of the chymotrypsin 
residue sequence shows the sequence Gly205-Ala206-Trp207-Thr208 occurs in chain 
G.&nbsp; From this, we can infer that the peptide bond that was hydrolyzed to 
give the substrate was Thr, and that, prior to hydrolysis, the sequence would 
have been Gly250-Ala251-Trp252-Thr253.&nbsp; To regenerate the peptide, one of 
the oxygen atoms on the -COO group on Trp252 would need to be replaced by a NH 
of Thr253.&nbsp; Careful inspection of the environment of Trp252 shows one of 
the oxygen atoms, atom number 1784, is ideally positioned to hydrogen bond to 
hydrogen atoms on Gly193 and Ser195, two of the residues in the oxyanion hole. 
The other oxygen atom, atom number 1765, is therefore the atom that would need 
to be replaced by the nitrogen of Thr253.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10">
Editing the tripeptide <em>in situ</em> to replace the oxygen atom by a 
threonine residue requires a good GUI.&nbsp; The Thr253 has a hydroxyl group 
that could potentially hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Trp252.&nbsp; If 
the hydroxyl group is positioned so that this hydrogen bond could form, and the 
geometry re-optimized, then the minimum energy structure is generated, and the 
carbonyl oxygen of Trp252 now forms three hydrogen bonds in the oxyanion hole.&nbsp; </p>
