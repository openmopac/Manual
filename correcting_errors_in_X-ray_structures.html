<h1>Correcting errors in the X-ray structure</h1>
<p>
<font face="Arial">

Of their nature,

X-ray structures are physics, not chemistry.&nbsp; A good X-ray structure will 
have a resolution of ~1&Aring;.&nbsp; X-ray structures are very good for secondary 
(alpha helices, beta sheets, etc.) and tertiary (folding and packing of alpha 
helices and beta sheets, etc.) structures, but are not good in predicting bond 
lengths and angles.&nbsp; On the other hand, semiempirical methods are good at 
predicting chemical structures, but are of lower accuracy in predicting 
secondary and tertiary structures.&nbsp; By combining the two techniques, 
structures that are of unprecedented accuracy can be generated.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">

Once the positions of the hydrogen atoms have been optimized and the structure 
re-checked, errors in the positions of the heavy atoms can be corrected by a 
constrained geometry optimization.&nbsp; The constraint is that the optimized 
structure is biased towards the starting X-ray structure.&nbsp; This bias is 
provided by the keyword <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF="SELF"</tt></a>&nbsp; This 
provides a bias of 3 kcal/mol per &Aring;ngstrom squared in favor of the X-ray 
structure.&nbsp; This has little effect on bond lengths, and angles, but has a 
large effect on tertiary structures, particularly when the inter-chain forces 
are weak.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">In some cases, the PDB structure errors are very large.&nbsp; 
When severe errors are found, correct them before proceeding.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">To set up a run, edit the archive file from the optimization 
of the positions of the hydrogen atoms, to give a new data set, call this &lt;name_Geo_Ref&gt;.mop&nbsp; 
In addition to any keywords that are specific to the system, e.g.,
<a href="start_res.html"><tt>START_RES=(text)</tt></a> and <a href="chains.html">
<tt>CHAINS=(TEXT)</tt></a>, add the keywords <a href="gnorm.html"><tt>GNORM=20</tt></a>
<a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> <tt> <a href="pl.html">PL</a>
<a href="pdbout.html">PDBOUT</a>,</tt> and <tt>GEO_REF="SELF"</tt> </font> </p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Start the job running.&nbsp; Monitor it for the first two or 
three cycles, and if all is well, let it run unattended.&nbsp; Geometry 
optimization of a protein is a time consuming operation; the job will run for a 
day up to three weeks, depending on the size of the system.&nbsp; The default maximum 
run time is two days.&nbsp; If it runs out of time and stops, then edit the data 
set to add the keywords <a href="t=n.html"><tt>T=2w</tt></a> and <a href="restart.html">
<tt>RESTART</tt></a>, then re-run the data set.&nbsp; This will re-start 
at the geometry where the previous run ended, and will re-calculate the SCF; 
this eliminates any accumulated errors in the SCF from the previous run.&nbsp; 
Then let it run again.&nbsp; If it still needs more time, examine the output to 
verify that the system is optimizing properly.&nbsp; If it isn't, then looking for errors in the data set.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Once the constrained optimization is complete, 
<a href="compare.html">compare</a> the 
starting and final structures, looking for changes.&nbsp; Verify that the changes 
are improvements (they should all be improvements).&nbsp; In particular, look at 
possible errors in the original PDB structure, and see if they have been 
corrected.</font></p>
