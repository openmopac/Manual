BZ
</h1>
When <tt>BZ</tt> is present, information on a polymer, layer, or crystal is written to a 
file, &lt;file&gt;.brz.&nbsp; This information can be used by the 
<a href="Program_BZ.html">program BZ</a> to 
explore the band structure in the Brillouin zone of the solid.
<p>Do not attempt to add keyword <tt>BZ</tt>.&nbsp; Use the utility program
<a href="makpol.html">MAKPOL</a> with keyword "LET" - that will make a data set 
in the correct format.</p>
<p>In order for <tt>BZ</tt> to work, certain specific conditions must be 
satisfied, these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data set must consist of a set of fundamental unit cells, in a specific 
order.&nbsp; For a solid, the order of unit cells is (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), 
... (0,1,0), (1,1,0), ... (0,0,1), (1,0,1), ...(0,1,1), (1,1,1), ... (n,l,m).&nbsp; 
Within each unit cell, the order of the atoms must be exactly the same.&nbsp; 
Because these conditions make writing the data set very difficult, the utility program
<a href="makpol.html">MAKPOL</a> should always be used to create the data set.&nbsp; 
MAKPOL is normally used for generating data sets for modeling the chemistry of 
solids, mainly organic systems, so the default in MAKPOL is for the data set to 
consist of entire molecules.&nbsp; For band-structure work, an extra keyword 
"LET" must be added; this suppresses the operation that generates entire 
molecules, and instead makes a data set suitable for use with <tt>BZ</tt>.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>When "LET" is present, only the atoms that make up the unit cell should be 
  present.&nbsp; The unit cell must also be stoichiometric, that is, there must 
  be an exact integer multiple of the formula present.&nbsp; For example, TiO<sub>2</sub> 
  in the rutile structure has a unit cell with one titanium atom at a vertex and 
  one at the center of the tetragonal unit cell.&nbsp;&nbsp; There must also be 
  four oxygen atoms, two inside the unit cell and two on the surface of the unit 
  cell.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keyword MERS must be present.&nbsp; This is written out when MAKPOL is run, 
and it should not be edited or deleted.&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Large Unit Cell (LUC) used must be sufficiently large that all phenomena 
relating to solid-state effects would not change if the LUC was increased in 
size.&nbsp; This condition is normally satisfied if the LUC could hold a sphere 
of diameter 9 <font face="Arial">&Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; For narrow band gap solids 
(the semiconductors) and true metals, the LUC might need to be larger, for 
example big enough to hold a sphere of diameter 10 or 11 &Aring;ngstroms.<br/>
&nbsp;</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">The geometry should not be modified after MAKPOL is 
  run.&nbsp; This means that if geometry optimization is run, the optimized 
  geometry should then be used in constructing a new data set for MAKPOL. </font>
</li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">Two types of file can be generated by BZ: electronic band 
structure files and phonon band structure files.&nbsp; If an electronic band 
structure is needed, then at least one SCF calculation must be run, and a normal 
output must be generated, i.e., an output that includes the line "FINAL HEAT OF 
FORMATION"&nbsp; If a phonon band structure is needed, then a
<a href="force.html"><tt>FORCE</tt></a> calculation must be run.&nbsp; This 
calculation normally takes a long time to run, so a useful strategy is to write 
out the force matrix (using <a href="isotope.html"><tt>ISOTOPE</tt></a>) as an insurance 
in case anything goes wrong.&nbsp; If something does go wrong, then correct the 
error and use <a href="restart.html"><tt>RESTART</tt></a> to re-run the end of the job. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To summarize, for an electronic band structure 
calculation, use keywords <tt>BZ</tt> <tt>MERS=(n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>,n<sub>3</sub>)</tt> and possibly <a href="one_scf.html">
<tt>1SCF</tt></a>, together with a data set generated by the program MAKPOL.&nbsp; 
For a phonon band structure calculation, use keywords <tt>BZ</tt> <tt>MERS=(n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>,n<sub>3</sub>)</tt> <tt>FORCE</tt> and possibly
<tt>RESTART</tt>, </font></p>
