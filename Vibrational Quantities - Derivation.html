Derivation of vibrational quantities (<a href="theory.html#Normal%20Coordinate%20Calculation">Back 
to theory</a>)</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">
Molecular vibrations can be expressed in two very different ways.&nbsp; The 
simpler way to describe a vibration is as a simple harmonic motion of the atoms 
in a molecule.&nbsp; For example, in the case of the diatomic nitrogen molecule, 
N<sub>2</sub>, the normal mode of vibration consists of the two nitrogen atoms 
moving together and apart.&nbsp; This is the classical way of describing a 
vibration.&nbsp; The other way is to describe molecular vibrations in terms of 
quantum-theoretical wavefunctions.&nbsp; For the N<sub>2</sub> normal mode, the 
wavefunction would have a positive value in the region of space around one of 
the nitrogen atoms, and a negative value in the region of space around the other 
nitrogen atom, that is, there would be a phase-change in going from one atom to 
the other.&nbsp; To understand the significance of this, be aware that quantum 
theory predicts that the probability of finding an atom at any given point in 
space can be obtained from the square of the vibration wavefunction at that 
point.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1">
The quantum theoretical description is definitely more complicated than the 
classical picture, and involves some phenomena that have no equivalent in the 
real world, the world we live in.&nbsp; A simple example of such a 
phenomenon can be provided by comparing the classical and quantum descriptions 
of the vibration of an N<sub>2</sub> molecule.&nbsp; In the classical 
description of the vibration, each nitrogen atom moves away from its equilibrium 
position, slows down, stops, then reverses direction.&nbsp; So each atom spends 
most of its time at the extremes of the vibration and a smaller amount of time 
at in the region of the equilibrium position.&nbsp; This is characteristic of 
simple harmonic motion.&nbsp; The quantum description is that the two nitrogen 
atoms spend most of their time in the region of the extremes of the classical vibration.&nbsp; This, 
too, is similar to the classical description.&nbsp; But the quantum and 
classical descriptions differ when the probability of finding the two atoms in 
the region of the equilibrium position is calculated.&nbsp; In the quantum 
picture, the probability of finding the atoms near to the equilibrium position 
drops to exactly zero.&nbsp; This is a direct consequence of the phase-change in 
the wavefunction in v=1.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
Within MOPAC, the vibrational analysis uses a mixture of quantum and classical 
descriptions.&nbsp; Quantum theory is used in calculating the vibrational 
frequencies and their wavefunctions, and classical theory is used in mapping out 
the trajectories of the atoms in each vibration. Concepts such as atom position, 
velocity, acceleration, simple harmonic motion, etc., are classical.&nbsp; 
Eigenstates (vibrational frequencies), eigenfunctions (normal modes), 
orthonormality of the modes, probability distributions, etc., are quantum 
theoretical.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
In the following derivations the first part uses mainly quantum theory, and the 
second part uses mainly classical theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; A common drawback in many 
descriptions of vibrational phenomena is that relating algebraic expressions to 
real quantities is often difficult.&nbsp; To reduce the effort required in 
relating expressions and numerical values, these relationships will be given 
when appropriate.&nbsp; A good starting point for all numerical work is a list 
of the <a href="Vibrational%20Quantities%20-%20Constants.html">Fundamental and Secondary constants</a> 
used in this analysis.</p>
<h2>
Calculation of Vibrational Frequencies</h2>
<p class="auto-style1">
Vibrational frequencies are calculated using a Hessian matrix; 
this is a 3N x 3N matrix of second derivatives of the energy with respect to 
Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; In its original form, the Hessian matrix is in kcal 
mol<sup>-1</sup> &Aring;<sup>-2</sup> , but the usual form for representing the 
force matrix is in (millidynes &Aring;<sup>-1</sup>), so this conversion is made 
before the matrix is used (see <a href="Hessian_Matrix.html">Hessian Matrix</a>;).&nbsp; 
The Hessian matrix is then mass-weighted.&nbsp; Diagonalization of this matrix 
produces normal modes and eigenvalues that can be converted into vibrational 
frequencies and other quantities. </p>
<h2>Worked examples of derivation of various properties</h2>
<p>Steps in modeling the vibration of a nitrogen molecule are 
<a href="Vibrational%20Quantities%20-%20Worked%20examples.html">described</a>.&nbsp; 
Nitrogen was chosen as the example system because it's a stable, diatomic, 
closed-shell molecule. &nbsp; Quantities calculated include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Force constants</li>
<li>Reduced masses</li>
<li>Vibrational energies as cm<sup>-1</sup> (frequencies or wavenumbers), kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, 
	Joules, and ergs</li>
<li>Initial velocity in centimeters per second</li>
<li>Period of oscillation in femtoseconds</li>
<li>Angular frequency in reciprocal seconds</li>
<li>Zero point energy</li>
<li>Travel in &Aring;ngstroms. </li>
<li>Vibrational transition dipole (system used is HCl)</li>
</ul>
<p>Equations for each step are given, and then applied to the N<sub>2</sub> 
or HCl 
molecule.</p>
<p>Nitrogen does not have a vibrational transition dipole, so for that 
calculation a molecule of hydrogen chloride was used.</p>
<h2>Quantum versus classical description of vibrations</h2>
<p>
A discussion of the relationship of
<a href="Vibrational%20Quantities%20-%20Quantum%20versus%20Classical%20vibrations.html">
quantum and classical</a> vibrational quantities is presented.&nbsp; The main 
differences are that the energies of vibrations predicted using quantum theory 
are quantized, and the ground-state energy predicted by quantum theory is 
non-zero.</p>
