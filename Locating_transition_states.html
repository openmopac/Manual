Locating Transition States </h1>
<p>Locating transition state geometries is different from optimizing ground 
states, where general all-purpose methods can be used.&nbsp; Locating a 
transition state geometry involves deciding on which of several different strategy 
should be used. 
Several options are available. 
These range from simple one-step optimizations to quite complicated processes.&nbsp; The 
choice of which option to use depends on the type of reaction that is being 
studied.&nbsp; In general, the simplest method that will locate the 
transition state should be used.&nbsp; Be aware that sometimes none of the techniques described below will work.&nbsp; 
When that happens, the possibility that there is a fault in the model of the 
chemical system must be considered, and 
that a re-examination of the project might be necessary.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Techniques for locating transition states</h2>
<p>In order of complexity, these are:</p>
<h3><a href="Narcissistic%20reactions.html">Narcissistic reactions</a></h3>
<p>In narcissistic reactions the reactants and products look the same.&nbsp; 
Reactions of this type are also called fluxional and degenerate rearrangement 
reactions; all three names reflect the fact that the product(s) of reaction are 
essentially the same as the reactant(s), the only difference being that the 
order of the atoms has changed.&nbsp; If this option can be used - use it!&nbsp; 
It's simple, fast, and reliable.</p>
<h3 class="auto-style3">More complicated methods</h3>
<p>All the following methods involve two steps.&nbsp; The first step depends on 
the method used, and produces a geometry that is near to the transition state.&nbsp; 
This approximate transition state geometry is then optimized to produce the 
refined transition state.&nbsp; For this, any of the standard transition state 
refinement methods can be used: <tt><a href="ts.html">TS</a></tt>, <a href="sigma.html"><tt>SIGMA</tt></a> or <a href="nllsq.html"><tt>NLLSQ</tt></a>.</p>
<h3><a href="Almost%20narcissistic%20reactions.html">Almost narcissistic 
reactions</a></h3>
<p class="auto-style2">For convenience, reactions that are similar, but not the 
same as, narcissistic reactions can be modeled using a method similar to that 
used for narcissistic reactions.&nbsp; The only difference is the addition of a 
step to optimize the transition state geometry. As with true narcissistic 
reactions, if this option can be used - use it!&nbsp; It's almost as simple, 
fast, and reliable as the narcissistic reactions.</p>
<h3>
<a href="Use%20of%20reaction%20path%20to%20locate%20a%20transition%20state.html">Use of reaction path</a></h3>
<p>
In some reactions, one specific atomic parameter, either an interatomic 
distance, bond angle, or dihedral, can be identified as being related to the 
reaction path.&nbsp; In this type of reaction, simply increasing or decreasing 
the atomic parameter will allow the path to be mapped out.&nbsp; The transition 
state geometry is then the highest point on the reaction path.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>
<a href="Locating%20transition%20state%20geometries%20using%20a%20reaction%20path%20defined%20with%20a%20dummy%20atom.html">Use of reaction path, starting near the transition state</a></h3>
<p class="auto-style2">This option is new in the sense that it has not been used 
before.&nbsp; However, it is not new in that it uses tools that have existed in MOPAC 
for a long time.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">In reactions where an atom, A, moves from being bonded to 
another atom, B, to being bonded to a third atom, C, can be assumed to have a 
transition state somewhere between B and C.&nbsp; Using symmetry, a dummy atom 
is placed at a point equidistant from B and C, and a reaction path for atom A is 
then constructed.&nbsp; Atom A is moved in a straight line from atom B to the 
dummy atom, and then in a line away from atom B, still in a straight line away 
from atom B.&nbsp; At each point on this line the positions of all atoms, and, 
most important, the position of the dummy atom are optimized.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Setting up this type of reaction path requires a significant effort, but as with 
the first few methods, when it can be used it is very reliable.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CPU intensive methods SADDLE and LOCATE-TS</h3>
<p>If at all possible, avoid using these methods.&nbsp; They are very CPU 
intensive, and quite often require the user to make value judgments. They are, 
however, often the only techniques that are successful when working with 
enzymes.</p>
<p>Both methods use two data-sets, one that represents the reactants and one for 
the products.&nbsp; Both methods work by reducing the distance,<em> R</em><sub>RP</sub>, 
between the systems representing the reactants and products, in a systematic 
manner.&nbsp; </p>
<p>SADDLE works by moving whichever system has the lower energy in the direction 
of the other system, that is, it reduces <em>R</em><sub>RP</sub> by moving one 
system towards the other while holding the other system fixed.&nbsp; The 
geometry of the moving system is then optimized, subject to the constraint that
<em>R</em><sub>RP</sub> is held constant.&nbsp; If the optimized heat of 
formation rises above that of the system that was held fixed, then the roles are 
reversed.&nbsp; That is, the system that was held fixed is now optimized subject 
to the <em>R</em><sub>RP</sub> constraint, and the system that was being 
optimized is now held fixed.&nbsp; This procedure slowly moves both systems up 
the reaction barrier while simultaneously keeping the heats of the two systems 
roughly the same. Eventually <em>R</em><sub>RP</sub> becomes small enough that 
gradient minimization methods can be used for refining the transition state. </p>
<p>LOCATE-TS works in a different way.&nbsp; It uses a bias to move both systems 
towards each other.&nbsp; The bias can be regarded as a force pulling the 
reactants towards the products, and pulling the products towards the reactants.&nbsp; 
Both pulls are equal and opposite in direction.&nbsp; At each step, the geometries 
of both systems are optimized, subject to the bias; at the end of each step both 
systems will be in equilibrium with the bias.&nbsp; This means that the slope of 
the reaction barrier for one system is equal and opposite to the slope of the 
other system.&nbsp; Put another way, the gradients due to the bias acting on 
both systems are equal and opposite.&nbsp; Motion up the reaction barrier is 
achieved by increasing the bias.&nbsp; Near the top of the barrier, the slope 
decreases as the transition state is approached, and gradient minimization 
methods can then be used for refining the transition state.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So SADDLE works by moving up the barrier by moving whichever system has the 
lower energy in the direction of the other system, and LOCATE-TS works by moving 
both systems up the barrier simultaneously, while keeping the slope of the 
barrier the same by using a bias.&nbsp; In practice, the LOCATE-TS method is 
more efficient than the SADDLE method.</p>
<h3>
<a href="Use%20of%20the%20SADDLE%20technique%20to%20locate%20a%20transition%20state.html">Use of the SADDLE technique</a></h3>
<p>
For more complicated reactions, the fact that the transition-state geometry is 
the highest point on the lowest-energy path between reactants and products can 
be used for locating it.&nbsp; The SADDLE technique uses as data both the optimized reactant 
geometry and the optimized product geometry.&nbsp; It calculates the distance in &Aring;ngstroms 
between the two, and whichever system has the lower heat of 
formation is moved a small distance towards the other geometry, thus shortening 
the distance between them.&nbsp; If the new &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> is still lower than that of the other geometry, another step is 
taken.&nbsp; When the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> rises above that of the other 
geometry, the stationary and moving geometries are swapped around. This 
procedure results in the distance between the two geometries getting steadily 
shorter, and both geometries have roughly the same heat of formation, and the 
transition state geometry is somewhere between the two geometries. Eventually 
the distance becomes very small, and the average of the two geometries is then a 
good approximation to the transition state. </p>
<h3>
<a href="Use%20of%20the%20LOCATE-TS%20technique%20to%20locate%20a%20transition%20state.html">Use of LOCATE-TS technique</a></h3>
<p>
<em>This technique is particularly suitable for modeling complicated systems 
such as transition states for individual steps in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.</em></p>
<p>
An alternative to the SADDLE technique is to replace the&nbsp;&Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
criterion with the gradient criterion.&nbsp; In the LOCATE-TS method, the 
starting point is the same as in the SADDLE technique.&nbsp; A bias or force is 
then applied to both the reactants and products, pulling them towards each 
other.&nbsp; This force is steadily increased until the approximate transition 
state is located.&nbsp; The transition state is then refined in a set of 
two-step operations.&nbsp; One operation involves gradient minimization of only 
those atoms that are directly involved in the reaction, the other operation is 
an unconstrained geometry optimization of all the other atoms.</p>
<p>
Once an acceptable transition state geometry is obtained, it should be further 
refined by running the geometry optimization with a tighter criterion, for 
proteins GNORM=5 would be appropriate.&nbsp; Monitor the job to watch the heat 
of formation.&nbsp; When it stops decreasing (it does not decrease over say 50 - 
100 cycles) the geometry can be considered as being at an energy minimum.</p>
<p>
Caveat: The LOCATE-TS technique uses the MOZYME LMO method, and will not work 
for systems that cannot be run using MOZYME.</p>
<h3>
<a href="Use%20of%20a%202-D%20grid%20to%20locate%20a%20transition%20state.htm">
Use of a two-dimensional grid</a></h3>
<p>
Use this technique only for demonstration purposes.&nbsp; It produces a 
two-dimensional contour map for a reaction.&nbsp; The X and Y dimensions are two 
geometric variables, and the third dimension is the energy at that point.&nbsp; 
Visual inspection should show the approximate location of the transition state.&nbsp; 
Re-running the job, focusing on the region around the transition state, should 
produce a more refined geometry.</p>
<p>
Although this technique can be used with proteins it is very CPU intensive.&nbsp; 
A better alternative is to use a mixture of LOCATE-TS and SADDLE.&nbsp; Use 
LOCATE-TS with a small bias, for example LOCATE-TS(C:3,3,3,5,5;), to quickly 
minimize the distance between the reactants and products, then switch to SADDLE 
to ascend the barrier.</p>
