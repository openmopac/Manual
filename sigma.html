<tt>SIGMA</tt>
</h1>
When refining transition states, and <tt><a href="ts.html">TS</a></tt> is <em>not</em> wanted, the McIver-Komornicki
gradient norm minimization&nbsp;[<a href="references.html#sigma1">9</a>,<a href="references.html#sigma2">10</a>]
routines, POWSQ and
SEARCH, can    be used by including <tt>SIGMA</tt>.  These are
very rapid routines, but do not work
for all species.  If the gradient norm is low, i.e., less  than  about  5
units,   then   <tt>SIGMA</tt>  will  probably  work;  in  most  cases where <tt>TS</tt>
does not work,  <tt><a href="nllsq.html">NLLSQ</a></tt>  is
recommended.  SIGMA first calculates a  Hessian  matrix,  a
slow  step,  then works out the direction of fastest descent, and searches
along that direction until the gradient norm is minimized.   The  Hessian
is  then  partially  updated  in  light of the new gradients, and a fresh
search direction found.  Clearly, if the Hessian changes  markedly  as  a
result  of  the  line-search, the update done will be inaccurate, and the
new search direction will be faulty.
        <tt>SIGMA</tt> should be avoided if at all  possible  when  non-variationally
   optimized calculations are being done.
<p>
If the Hessian is suspected to be corrupt within SIGMA, it  will  be
   automatically  recalculated.  This frequently speeds up the rate at which
   the transition state is located.  If you do not want the  Hessian  to  be
   reinitialized--it is costly in CPU time--specify <tt><a href="let.html">LET</a></tt> on the keyword
   line.
