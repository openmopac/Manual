<tt>CUTOFP=<i>n</i>.<i>nn</i></tt> </a>
</h1>
In polymers and solids, a cutoff distance, in &Aring;ngstroms, is needed in order to ensure that
every atom has a correct electric environment.  If no cutoff is set, then
equivalent atoms would experience different electric fields.  The <tt>CUTOFP</tt>
distance is set, by default, to 30 &Aring;ngstroms.  In calculating the potential
due to distant atoms, atoms separated by more than <tt>CUTOFP</tt> are treated
as if they were at distance <tt>CUTOFP</tt>.
<p>
<a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> calculations run faster when smaller 
values of <tt>CUTOFP</tt> are used&nbsp; A suitable value for<i> n.nn</i> is 
somewhere between 10.0 and 15.0.&nbsp; This will give a 
large increase in speed. But first, run a test calculation to verify that the 
results don't change much.</p>
<p>
When <tt>CUTOFP</tt> is less than the default, the number of two-electron 
integrals is reduced.&nbsp; This can allow larger systems to be run.</p>
