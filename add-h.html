<tt>ADD-H</tt></h1>
<p align="left">
Adds hydrogen atoms to a data set to satisfy valence requirements.&nbsp; Most 
sites are neutralized, the exceptions being: (A) Metal atoms normally exist as 
ions, e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>+</sup>, and halogen atoms that are not 
covalently bonded, e.g. Cl<sup>-</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>, are represented as the 
appropriate ions.&nbsp; (B) Some organic species that normally exist in the 
ionized form, such as N-methyl pyridine, are hydrogenated so that the result is 
the conventional ionized moiety.&nbsp; Hydrogen atoms are added to all other 
species to produce the neutralized species.&nbsp; Pairs of residues that can 
exist as <a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a> sometimes form spontaneously when the 
positions of the hydrogen atoms are optimized.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
The 
results are suitable for use in preparing a MOPAC data 
set.&nbsp; This keyword is intended for use with proteins only.&nbsp; It should 
work for non-proteins as well, but there is an increased probability that it 
will make mistakes, and for systems that cannot exist in aqueous media, such as 
LiCH3, there is an increased probability of failure. In a run to add hydrogen atoms, 
one or more sites can be ionized by using <a href="site.html"><tt>SITE</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
A useful option is to use <tt>SITE=(SALT)</tt>; when present all likely salt bridges 
between residues would be created.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
If any 
hydrogen atoms are present, they will be removed before <tt>ADD-H</tt> runs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When a PDB file is made, a set of checks is run to detect errors in the 
structure.&nbsp; By default, the sequence of atoms 
will be put into the standard PDB sequence.&nbsp; If this is not wanted, add
<a href="noreseq.html"><tt>NORESEQ</tt></a>.&nbsp; <tt>NORESEQ</tt> is also 
useful in the unlikely event that the <tt>ADD-H</tt> run reports an error in the residue recognition 
process.<img height="144" src="Guanine.gif" style="float: right" width="327"/></p>
<p align="left">
Whether specific sites should be ionized or not is hard to answer.&nbsp; For 
simplicity, <tt>ADD-H</tt> produces either the completely neutral protein, 
or, if definite ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> or [CH<sub>3</sub>-NC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, are present, the 
minimally ionized form.
</p>
<p align="left">
For the purposes of hydrogenation, most metal atoms are assumed to be completely 
ionic, i.e., they do not form bonds.&nbsp; This allows isolated oxygen atoms 
near to metal atoms to be converted into water, and not into hydroxide.</p>
<p align="left">
Sometimes, <tt>ADD-H</tt> makes mistakes.&nbsp; For example, both guanine and 
pyrimidine-2-one (see picture) have similar environments for the top left ring 
nitrogen atoms, but in guanine there is a hydrogen atom attached, while in 
pyrimidine-2-one that hydrogen atom is missing.&nbsp; This is a consequence of the 
positions of the two double bonds in the six-membered ring. That is, it is not a 
function of the nitrogen atom, nor of the carbon atom adjacent, but depends on 
the more distant atoms. Sometimes <tt>ADD-H</tt> makes mistakes with complicated 
structures like these, but for most PDB files,&nbsp;<tt>ADD-H</tt> works 
correctly.&nbsp; No errors were detected in <a href="add-H.zip">validation tests 
for a set of proteins</a>.&nbsp; If an example of an incorrect hydrogenation 
is found, please send details to openmopac(at)gmail.com

Recommended usage</h3>
<p align="left">
Starting with an un-modified PDB file, e.g. 1A1A.pdb.&nbsp; Edit a 
MOPAC data-set file to be 
named "1A1A ADD-H.mop"&nbsp; Use keywords "<tt><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>="1A1A.pdb" 
SITE=(SALT) ADD-H <a href="nooptx.html">NOOPT</a> <a href="opth.html">OPT-H</a>
<a href="html.html">HTML</a> <a href="charge.html">CHARGE</a>=0
<a href="gradients.html">GRADIENTS</a> <a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a>
<a href="eps.html">EPS</a>=78.4</tt>" and a title-line describing the system, e.g., 
"PDB file 1A1A with hydrogen atoms added, but positions not optimized"&nbsp; If 
you know that sites in addition to salt-bridges are ionized, add these 
ionizations to the <tt>SITE </tt>command.&nbsp; If there are several PDB files 
to be hydrogenated, use the <a href="setup.html"><tt>SETUP</tt></a> command to specify 
the hydrogenation keywords, e.g., <tt>SETUP="Add-H.txt"</tt> and have 
the SETUP file <tt>"Add-H.txt" </tt>consist of the single line <tt>
SITE=(SALT) ADD-H NOOPT OPT-H HTML CHARGE=0 GRADIENTS MOZYME EPS=78.4.</tt> Then 
only two keywords for each data-set would be needed, e.g., "<tt>GEO_DAT="1A1A.pdb" 
SETUP="Add-H.txt"</tt>". </p>
<p align="left">
Run the data-set, i.e., run "1A1A ADD-H.mop". That will produce an output and an 
ARC file.</p>
<p align="left">
To optimize the positions of the hydrogen atoms, run the newly-created ARC file.&nbsp; All the keywords that were used in the previous job will 
be present in the ARC file, with the exception of the keywords that were 
specific to ADD-H, i.e., <tt>GEO_DAT="1A1A.pdb" SITE=(SALT) </tt>and<tt> ADD-H</tt>; 
these are automatically deleted.&nbsp; This leaves a set of keywords that can be used in a normal MOPAC job to optimize 
the positions of the hydrogen atoms, while leaving all other atoms fixed.&nbsp; 
Normally an ARC file would not be used as a MOPAC data-set, but in this case its 
use simplifies the hydrogenation process by eliminating one step.&nbsp; The 
system should be neutral, unless metal atoms are present.&nbsp; If MOZYME 
predicts that the system has a net charge, then examine the charged sites to 
check that the charges are correct.&nbsp; Elements of Groups IA and IIA are 
always charged. Other metals, e.g, Zn, Fe, Ni, etc., might be charged. If a 
metal atom is assigned a negative charge in this run, use keyword
<a href="metal.html"><tt>METAL</tt></a> to make it 100% ionic.&nbsp; This will not affect 
the run, but might make the charges generated by <tt>
MOZYME</tt> look more reasonable.</p>
<h3 align="left">
Detecting faults in hydrogenation</h3>
<p align="left">
A simple way to check the hydrogenation is to run the system using keywords 
<tt><a href="charges.html">CHARGES</a> </tt>and <tt><a href="html.html">HTML</a></tt>, and then examine the output. 
All the ionized sites will be listed in the lines under "Ion Atom No."&nbsp; If <tt>SITE=(SALT)</tt> is used, there might be a lot of salt bridges listed - 
residues involved in salt bridges can easily be identified by the short distance 
to a residue of the opposite sign.&nbsp; Ignore them.&nbsp; Focus on the 
remaining charged sites.&nbsp; If any look strange, examine the environment 
using a GUI.&nbsp; Keyword <tt>HTML </tt>produces a file that is easy to examine.</p>
<p align="left">
Another way to find faults in 
the hydrogenation is to run a single SCF 
calculation and look at the forces acting on the non-hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; Start 
with the ARC file from the previous job, and replace keywords "<tt>NOOPT OPT-H</tt>" 
with "<tt><a href="one_scf.html">1SCF</a> <a href="invert.html">INVERT</a></tt>", then save the edited 
file.&nbsp; Use a descriptive name such as "1A1A Opt-H 1SCF.mop"&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Atoms that might be wrongly hydrogenated will have large gradients, typically over 100 kcal&middot;mol<sup>-1</sup>&middot;&Aring;<sup>-1</sup>. 
At this point, ignore and carboxylate groups - PDB analyses typically do not 
distinguish between the C=O and C-OH distances.&nbsp; Also, ignore large 
gradients in sulfate and phosphate groups.&nbsp; These are usually caused by 
errors in the PM7 method.&nbsp; Using a GUI (JSmol is ideal here), examine any 
atoms that have unexplained large gradients.&nbsp; Possibly one or more simple errors will be found where 
there are more or less hydrogen atoms attached to a heavy atom than expected.&nbsp; 
Add or delete hydrogen atoms as necessary, and re-run the "1A1A Opt-H 1SCF.mop" 
job.</p>
