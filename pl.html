<tt>PL</tt>
</h1>
A tool for monitoring the behavior of SCF calculations is useful when they take 
too long, or even fail altogether.&nbsp; When keyword <tt>PL</tt> is present, the energy of the system and the 
rate of change of the electronic structure can be monitored iteration to 
iteration.&nbsp; This keyword 
is useful particularly when trying out various combinations of convergers such 
as <tt><a href="pulay.html">PULAY</a></tt>, <tt><a href="king.html">KING</a></tt>, <tt>
<a href="shift.html">SHIFT</a></tt>, and <tt><a href="damp.html">DAMP</a></tt> 
to find the method that works best.<p>The rate of change in the electronic 
structure is given by the quantity PLS in the output.&nbsp; For example, in the 
line:</p><pre>ITERATION   7 PLS= 0.168E-01 0.395E-06 ENERGY      -34.585270 DELTAE   -2.2653063</pre>
the alpha wavefunction changed by 0.0168 between iteration 6 and iteration 7.  At the same time, the beta wavefunction changed by 0.000000395. 
The change in energy over these iterations is -2.265 kcal/mol.<p>If the 
calculation uses a restricted Hartree-Fock method, then the line would look like 
this: </p>
<pre>ITERATION   7 PLS= 0.900E-02 0.000E+00 ENERGY       46.712559 DELTAE   -0.3203785</pre>
<p>Now the change in total wavefunction between iteration 6 and 7 would be 
0.009.&nbsp; The second number, here 0.000E+00, is not used and should be 
ignored.</p>
<p>The precise meaning of PLS depends on whether the calculation uses
<a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> or the conventional, default, method.</p>
<h3>Definition of PLS for conventional SCF calculations</h3>
<p>In conventional methods, PLS is the largest change in any density matrix element on two successive iterations
in the SCF calculation. At self-consistency, this change drops to zero.&nbsp; 
For UHF calculations, both the alpha and beta density matrices are used, 
therefore two numbers are printed.&nbsp; The total density matrix is used in RHF 
calculations, and consequently the second number is not used.</p>
<h3>Definition of PLS for MOZYME calculations</h3>
<p>MOZYME calculations do not use a normal density matrix so the definition used 
above cannot be used.&nbsp; Instead, the largest Fock matrix element connecting 
an occupied LMO with any virtual LMO is used.&nbsp; This can be written as:</p>
<p align="center">PLS = |&lt;<font face="Symbol">y</font><sup>occ</sup>|F|<font face="Symbol">y</font><font face="Times New Roman"><sup>vir</sup>&gt;|</font></p>
<p>Although this definition is fundamentally different from that in conventional 
work, in that data from only one iteration is used and the units are now 
electron volts and not electrons, the meaning is the same - at self-consistency 
all Fock matrix elements connecting occupied and virtual LMOs are zero. 
Therefore, from a user's perspective, the significance of PLS in both 
conventional and MOZYME calculations is the same: it is a measure of how far the 
system is from self-consistency.</p>
