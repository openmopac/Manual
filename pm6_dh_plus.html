Computational modeling of biological systems is a rapidly evolving field that 
calls for methods that are able to allow for extensive sampling with systems 
consisting of thousands of atoms. Semiempirical quantum chemical (SE) methods 
are a promising tool to aid with this, but the rather bad performance of 
standard SE methods for non-covalent interactions is clearly a limiting factor. 
Enhancing SE methods with empirical corrections for dispersion and 
hydrogen-bonding interactions was found to be a big improvement, but for the 
hydrogen-bonding corrections the drawback of breaking down in the case of 
substantial changes to the hydrogen bond, e.g., proton transfer, posed a serious 
limitation for its general applicability. This work presents a further improved 
hydrogen bonding correction that can be generally included in parameter fitting 
procedures, as it does not suffer from the conceptual flaws of previous 
approaches: hydrogen bonds are now treated as an interaction term between 
electronegative acceptor and donor atoms, weighted by a function of the 
position of H atoms between them, and multiplied with a damping function to 
correct the short- and long-range behavior. The performance of the new approach 
is evaluated for PM6, AM1, OM3, and SCC-DFTB as well as several force-field (FF) 
methods for a number of standard benchmark sets with hydrogen-bonded systems. 
The new approach is found to reach the same accuracy as the second-generation 
hydrogen-bonding correction with less parameters, while it avoids among other 
issues the conceptual problem with electronic structure changes. SE methods 
augmented this way reach the accuracy of DFT-D approaches for a large number of 
cases investigated, while still being about 3 orders of magnitude faster. 
Moreover, the new correction scheme is transferable also to FF methods that were 
shown to have serious problems with hydrogen-bonding interactions.</span></p>

development of PM6-DH+.&nbsp; By contrast, in the proposed strategy, fully 
optimized geometries are used.&nbsp; No inconsistency is involved - by sketching 
a simple Born cycle, it becomes apparent that any errors arising from optimizing 
the PM6-DH+ parameters using frozen geometries and using those same parameters 
when calculating the binding energy using the above strategy would be very 
small; they would contribute only second order perturbation effects, and would 
be completely negligible.&nbsp; </font></p>
