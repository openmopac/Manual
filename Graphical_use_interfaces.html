<h1>Graphical User Interfaces</h1>
<p>A GUI is absolutely essential for working with proteins.&nbsp; There are many
<a href="/resellers.html">good GUIs</a>.&nbsp; If the MOPAC 
keyword <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> is used, a web-page will be written that 
would allow details of a protein to be examined using JSmol, and some simple geometric 
operations (optimizing the positions of small sets of atoms).&nbsp; This GUI is 
fast and simple to use, and is useful for exploring mechanisms.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a GUI</h2>
<p>A GUI must be able to read and write files that MOPAC can read and write.&nbsp; 
These include the &lt;name&gt;.mop and &lt;name&gt;.pdb, as well as &lt;name&gt;.arc files.</p>
<p>The GUI should allow structures to be manipulated (edited).</p>
<p>If the GUI can handle and edit residue sequences and backbone ribbons (alpha helices 
and beta sheets, etc.) that would be a bonus.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>A good GUI can make working with proteins much easier.&nbsp; If you are 
planning on buying a GUI, try working with it for a week or two.&nbsp; Make sure 
that you can perform all, or at least most, of the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read in a structure in one format, and write it out in another format, 
	and verify that atom 1 has not moved.</li>
<li>Move an atom in the middle of the data-set, then verify that atom 1 has 
	not moved.</li>
<li>Select a few (2 to 6) residues, and hide all the rest of the system.</li>
<li>Measure distances between pairs of atoms.</li>
<li>Somewhere in the structure, change a H to a C and, in one step (a few 
	clicks) convert the C into a normal methyl group. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some functions of GUIs that are utterly useless, and, if they cannot be 
disabled, make the GUI unacceptable for use in modeling proteins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic rectification of atoms by the addition of hydrogen atoms to 
	satisfy valence requirements.&nbsp; Adding hydrogen atoms requires several 
	steps, and any process that does it automatically is certain to make 
	mistakes.</li>
<li>Automatic optimization of the positions of hydrogen atoms.&nbsp; This 
	"one size fits all" approach usually fails because there are many exceptions to 
	rules.&nbsp; For example, if a hydrogen atom of a carboxylic acid group is 
	near to a water molecule that is near to a sulfate ion, the electrostatic 
	field of the sulfate polarizes the water which, in turn, might pull the 
	proton off the carboxylic acid group.&nbsp; Even if it does not pull the proton 
	off, the O-H bond-length in the carboxylic acid will be increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>These faults, if not detected, can invalidate weeks of work.</p>
