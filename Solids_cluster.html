 The Cluster</a>
</h2>
Unlike more conventional methods, MOPAC does not normally use a fundamental
unit cell.  Neither does it sample the Brillouin Zone in order to model the
electronic structure.  Instead, it uses a large unit cell, called a 'cluster', and applies the Born-von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n
&nbsp;[<a href="references.html#bornvon1">68</a>,<a href="references.html#bornvon2">69</a>] periodic  boundary conditions.  In this discussion,
the term 'solid' is intended to include polymers, layer systems, and true
solids, unless otherwise indicated by the context.
<p>
If a unit cell of a solid is large enough,  then  a  single  point  in <i>k</i>-space,  the &Gamma;
point,
is sufficient to specify the entire Brillouin zone.  The secular determinant
for this  point  can  be  constructed  by adding together the Fock matrix for
the central unit cell plus those for the adjacent unit cells.  The periodic
boundary conditions are satisfied, and diagonalization yields the correct
density matrix for the &Gamma; point.
</p><p>
At this point  in  the  calculation,  conventionally,  the  density matrix
for  each  unit  cell  is constructed.  Instead, the &Gamma;-point density
and  one-electron  density  matrices  are   combined   with "&Gamma;-point-like" Coulomb  and  exchange integral strings to
produce a new Fock matrix.  The  calculation  can  be  visualized  as  being
done entirely in reciprocal space, at the &Gamma; point.
</p><p>
Most  solid-state  calculations  take  a  very  long  time.   These
calculations,   called "Cluster" calculations   after  the  original
publication, require between 1.3 and 2 times  the  equivalent  molecular
calculation.<a name="BM18245">&nbsp;</a>
</p><p>
A minor 'fudge'  is  necessary  to  make  this  method  work.   The
contribution  to  the  Fock  matrix  element  arising  from the exchange
integral between an atomic orbital and all atomic orbitals which are more than
half a unit cell away must be ignored.
</p><p>
The unit cell must be large enough that an atomic  orbital  in  the center  of  the  unit  cell has an
insignificant overlap with the atomic orbitals at the ends of the  unit
cell.   In  practice,  a  translation vector  of more that about 7 or 8 &Aring;ngstrom is
sufficient.  For one rare group of compounds a larger translation vector is
needed.  Solids with delocalized <i> <span class="b">&pi;</span></i>-systems,  and  solids  with  very
small band-gaps will require a larger translation  vector,  in  order  to
accurately  sample <i>k</i>-space.   For these systems, a translation vector in the
order of  15-20 &Aring;ngstroms is needed.
