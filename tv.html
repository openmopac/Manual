<h2>Translation Vector for defining Polymers, Layer systems, and Solids</h2>
<p>Please use <a href="makpol.html"><tt>MAKPOL</tt></a> for 
building data-sets for solids, it is easier to use than constructing the Tv "by hand"&nbsp; 
If you do want to construct the translation vectors, the following information 
will be useful:</p>
<h3>Definition of Translation Vectors</h3>
<p>Translation vectors define the distance vectors that all atoms in the cluster 
are translated through to form another cluster in the solid.&nbsp; The Tv can 
be in Cartesian or internal coordinates.&nbsp; If a Tv is defined in Cartesian 
coordinates, then it is used directly.&nbsp; If it is defined in internal coordinates, then 
it is converted to 
Cartesian coordinates at run time, and the Cartesian 
coordinates of atom 1 (real or dummy) is subtracted from it.&nbsp; If atom 1 
is at the origin, i.e., at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) then the coordinates defined by Tv 
are the translation vectors,&nbsp;this simplifies visualizing the translation 
vectors using a GUI, in that a line drawn from atom 1 to the Tv would represent 
the translation vector. </p>
<p>Most GUI's cannot display the Tv because Tv is not a chemical symbol.&nbsp; 
To allow a GUI to display the Tv, edit the geometry to replace the Tv by an 
element that is not already in the system.&nbsp; A good choice would be He or Rn.&nbsp; 
If the translation vectors are to be displayed, make sure that atom 1 is real, 
not a dummy atom, and is at the origin.</p>
<p>In solids, the three translation vectors should define a cluster unit cell 
that is big enough to hold a sphere of diameter about 10 - 15&nbsp;&Aring;.&nbsp; 
This is to allow every atom in the cluster to interact with atoms in adjacent 
clusters as if they were different atoms.&nbsp; If a cluster unit cell was not 
large enough, an atom might interact incorrectly with its equivalent atom in an 
adjacent unit cell.&nbsp; If the cluster unit cell is too small, the error 
message "<span><strong>Volume of unit cell unreasonably small</strong>" will be printed and the 
job stopped.</span></p>
<h3>Historical and background 
interest.</h3>
The translation vector is the distance through which an atom must be moved
(translated) in order to be in the next unit cell.  The symbol for a
translation vector is <tt>Tv</tt>.  The <tt>Tv</tt> should be specified at the end
of the geometry. No real or dummy atoms should come after a <tt>Tv</tt>, although
symmetry data, etc, are allowed.  The order of the data is thus: (real and
dummy atoms) (translation vector(s)) (blank line) (symmetry data or MECI data
etc, if needed).
<p>Translation vectors can be defined in internal coordinates or Cartesian 
coordinates.&nbsp; Both definitions give rise to the same result, but the 
methods of definition are very different.&nbsp; Before proceeding, remember that 
atom positions are defined as being in internal coordinates if there is a 
connectivity.&nbsp; If there is no connectivity, the atom position is defined in 
Cartesian coordinates. The utility <a href="makpol.html"><tt>MAKPOL</tt></a> is provided 
to simplify construction of MOPAC data sets for solids.</p>
<p>The number of translation vectors determines the type of infinite solid.&nbsp; 
A polymer has one <tt>Tv</tt>, a layer system has two <tt>Tv</tt>, and a solid has three <tt>Tv.&nbsp; </tt></p>
<h4>Internal coordinate definition of translation vector </h4>
<p>If a <tt>Tv</tt> has a connectivity, then its position is defined using 
internal coordinates.&nbsp; The translation vector is then given by the 
difference in position of the atom the <tt>Tv</tt>&nbsp; is connected to and the 
position defined by <tt>Tv</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, consider polyethylene:

The 'bond length', 15.22 <font face="Courier New">&Aring;</font>ngstroms, is the distance 
of Tv from atom 1.  The direction is given by the angle (here 34 degrees) and dihedral (-0.04 degrees).  So atom 1, on translation, would be moved to the position of Tv.  All other atoms would then be moved the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>But this way of defining Tv has a severe drawback - a small change in the 
angle or dihedral of Tv would produce a large change in position of the Tv.&nbsp; 
An easy way around this is to define Tv in terms of atoms near to its desired 
position.&nbsp; To illustrate this, 
consider polyethylene again.&nbsp; By using the carbon atom at the end of the 
unit cell and two other atoms for angle and dihedral, the end of the data set 
would now look like 
this:</p>

</pre>
&nbsp;This is a perfectly general and robust method of defining Tv in terms 
of internal coordinates.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cartesian coordinate definition of translation vector </h4>
<p>If the connectivity is missing Tv is defined as Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; 
The absolute position of Tv defines the motion of all atoms.&nbsp; Consider polyethylene 
again.&nbsp; In Cartesian coordinates, the data set would be:</p><pre>Polyethylene, -[C12H24]-

<p>Now Tv is defined as X=12.57, Y=8.57, and Z=0.01.&nbsp; On translation, every 
atom would be displaced by this amount.&nbsp; Although it is the default, atom 1 
does not need to be at the origin, however if it is not at the origin, 
visualization of the translation vectors can be misleading.</p>
<p>The definition of Tv, Cartesian or internal, does not depend on the 
definitions of any of the other atoms, that is, some atoms can be in Cartesian 
coordinates and some in internal coordinates.&nbsp; The definitions gives here 
refer to the Tv only.</p>
<p>For polymers, internal coordinates are easier than Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; 
For solids, Cartesian coordinates are recommended, unless the system has high 
symmetry, in which case internal coordinates are preferred, as that allows 
extensive use of symmetry functions to reduce the number of geometric parameters 
to be optimized.&nbsp; In most high symmetry cases, only one or two geometric 
parameters need to be optimized.</p>
