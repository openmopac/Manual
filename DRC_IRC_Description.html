<h1><a name="SECTION0012191000000000000000">Description</a> of DRC/IRC</h1>
<p>The course of a molecular vibration can be followed by calculating the potential and kinetic energy at various times. Two extreme conditions can be identified: (a) gas phase, in which the total energy is a constant through time, there being no damping of the kinetic energy allowed, and (b) liquid phase, in which kinetic energy is always set to zero, the motion of the atoms being infinitely damped.<a name="BM22540">&nbsp;</a> </p>
<p>All possible degrees of damping are allowed. In addition, the facility exists to dump energy into the system, appearing as kinetic energy. As kinetic energy is a function of velocity, a vector quantity, the energy appears as energy of motion in the direction in which the molecule would naturally move. If the system is a transition state, then the excess kinetic energy is added after the intrinsic kinetic energy has built up to at least 0.2 kcal/mol.<a name="BM22541">&nbsp;</a> </p>
<p>For ground-state systems, the excess energy sometimes may not be added; if the intrinsic kinetic energy never rises above 0.2 kcal/mol then the excess energy will not be added. </p>
<h3>IRC Reaction Coordinate Definition</h3>
<p>The IRC is a purely geometric structure, that is, it is time-independent.&nbsp;
A plot of the IRC has two axes: potential energy and reaction coordinate.&nbsp;
While potential energy is easy to understand - it's just the heat of formation -
the meaning of the reaction coordinate is not so obvious. To understand the
meaning used here, consider the first half of a reaction, going from reactants
to the transition state. In this discussion, it is a requirement that the
Potential Energy Surface (PES) increases monotonically in going from reactant(s)
to the transition state. If this requirement&nbsp; is not true, then the PES can
be divided into two or more sections in such a manner that in each section the
requirement is true.&nbsp; The discussion that follows woiuld then apply to each
section.</p>
<p>Both reactants and transition state have well-defined geometries.&nbsp; For
the transition state, it is the stationary point on the PES which is the highest
point on the minimum energy path from reactants to products. If the reactant is
a single entity, e.g. the keto-enol tautomerization reaction, then it is that
entity in its lowest energy configuration. If the reactant consists of two
entities, e.g. the Diels Alder reaction or the Sn2 CH3Cl + F(-) reaction, then
it is the associated complex. If no associated complex is formed, then it is the
two isolated species.</p>
<p>The "length" of the reaction coordinate can be defined as follows:&nbsp; In
the definition of the Cartesian geometry, let both the transition state and the
reactants share the same center of mass. No rotation is permitted. Given that
the coordinate of atom <i>i</i> in the reactant(s) is&nbsp; R<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z),
and the corresponding coordinate in the products is P<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z), then
the length, L, of the reaction coordinate is:</p>
<p align="center">L = (&Sigma;<font face="Times New Roman"><sub>i</sub>(</font>R<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z)
-P<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z))<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup></p>
<p align="left">The reaction coordinate is represented by a set of points. The
difference in geometry between each adjacent point on the reaction coordinate
can be defined in a similar manner. By default, the <a href="x-priority0.html">
step-size</a> is 0.05 Angstroms, so the difference, <span class="b">&Delta;</span>l
between the geometries of two points, X(j) and X(j+1), on a reaction coordinate
is: </p>
<p align="center"><span class="b">&Delta;</span>l = 0.05 = (&Sigma;<font face="Times New Roman"><sub>i</sub>(</font>X(j)<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z)
-X(j+1)<sub>i</sub>(x,y,z))<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup></p>
<p align="left">Note that the addition of all the step-sizes is <i>not</i> equal
to the length of the reaction coordinate. It would only be equal if the reaction
coordinate involved all atoms moving in straight lines; as this only occurs in
diatomic reactions, this condition is normally not satisfied.&nbsp; In the
output, the difference between each pair of points is a constant, when <tt><a href="x-priority0.html"><u><font color="#0000ff">X-PRIORITY</font></u></a></tt>
is in force, and the distance from the transition state is also printed.</p>
<h3>DRC Reaction Coordinate Definition</h3>
<p>Unlike the IRC, the default coordinate for the DRC is time, with a default <a href="t-priority0.html"><font color="#0000ff"><u>
step size</u></font></a> of 0.1 fs. For long trajectories, particularly those of
several picoseconds, a time step on 1 or more femtoseconds is suggested.</p>
