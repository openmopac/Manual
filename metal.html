When adding hydrogen atoms using <a href="add-h.html"><tt>ADD-H</tt></a></h3>
<p align="left">
All atoms defined as metals are assumed to be 100% ionic.&nbsp; As a result, 
oxygen and sulfur atoms near to a metal atom will be automatically ionized.&nbsp; 
This can produce structures such as -CH<sub>2</sub>-COO(-) ... Na(+) and -CH<sub>2</sub>-COO(-) 
... Ca(+2).</p>
<h3 align="left">
In Lewis structures for MOZYME calculations</h3>
<p align="left">
Some elements might need to be defined as not having 
any covalent bonds when building the <a href="Lewis_structures.html">Lewis structure</a>.&nbsp; This can be in order 
to generate a sensible Lewis structure for the user or, in rare instances, to 
generate an acceptable Lewis structure for MOZYME.</p>
<p align="left">
Consider ferrocene.&nbsp; In ferrocene, iron has 8 valence electrons, so if it is 
allowed to bond to the carbon atoms, it would form 8 covalent sigma bonds.&nbsp; 
In such a system, iron would thus be Fe(VIII).&nbsp; In a zinc finger, if Zn 
bonds to the four ligands, it would have a formal charge of -2.&nbsp; Such 
unusual oxidation states or charges might be of concern to users, however in 
most cases they would not affect the MOZYME calculation.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
Individual elements and individual atoms can be re-defined as not forming any 
covalent bonds by use of METAL.&nbsp; In building Lewis structures, all elements 
of Groups I and II are considered as being fully ionic.&nbsp; If they need to be 
considered as covalent, use <tt> <a href="CVB.html">
CVB</a></tt> to define bonds.</p>
<p align="left">
The oxidation state can be changed using METAL by adding the new 
oxidation state immediately after the chemical symbol.&nbsp; The new oxidation 
state must be in the specific form +n, 0 or -n, so, for example [Sc<sup>I</sup>]<sup>+</sup> 
would be Sc(+1).&nbsp; Note that the "+1" is needed, and that Sc(+), without the 
"1" would not be allowed.</p>
<p align="left">
Individual elements are specified by their chemical symbol, individual atoms are 
specified by the atom-number of the real atom (Real atoms numbers exclude 
any dummy atoms), or by the PDB or JSmol labels.</p>
<p align="left">
By default, elements of Group IA (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and some of Group IIA (Mg, 
Ca, Sr, Ba) are considered metals.</p>
