<h1 class="auto-style1">Trial-and-error methods for locating transition states</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>For most simple reactions, i.e., reactions where a stable stationary point 
goes to another stable stationary point, the transition state can be located 
using&nbsp; <a href="Locate-TS.html"><tt>LOCATE-TS</tt></a>.&nbsp; When <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> 
fails, there are definite procedures that can be followed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style2">User errors:</span></strong> Most failures 
of <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> 
are due to user errors.&nbsp; This sounds harsh, but during the testing phase of
<tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> 
several failures were encountered.&nbsp; In every case a fault in the chemistry 
of the reaction was found.&nbsp; Two typical faults were: (A) There was an 
intermediate stable minimum between the reactant and the product, and (B) There 
was a typographical error - a simple user mistake.&nbsp; Given that enzymes 
lower activation barriers, if the calculated barrier is large, carefully examine 
the reaction to see if there could be an alternative step that would lower the 
barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;In the first stage of <tt>LOCATE-TS</tt> 
structures <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are moved towards each 
other.&nbsp; At the start of this process, a weak force is used to roughly orientate <strong>A</strong> 
and <strong>B</strong>, then the force is increased so that the two structures 
move up the barrier, and the distance between them gets less and less.&nbsp; 
Finally, when the distance is small enough (the largest motion of any atom is 
less than about 0.7 &Aring;) the geometries of the two structures are averaged, 
and the resulting structure is used as the starting point for the gradient 
minimization. At this point, three files are printed out: 
&lt;file&gt;_30p0_average.mop, &lt;file&gt;_30p0_first.mop, and &lt;file&gt;_30p0_second.mop. 
(This assumes that the final pull was 30 kcal/mol/&Aring;.)</p>
<p><span class="auto-style2"><strong>Add more steps to the orientation process:</strong>
</span>Look at &lt;file&gt;_30p0_first.mop and &lt;file&gt;_30p0_second.mop.&nbsp; 
These should be obviously related to 
structures <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> .&nbsp; If they are not, 
and you're sure that the the starting points are correct, try using more steps 
in <tt>LOCATE-TS.</tt></p>
<p><span class="auto-style2"><strong>Check the starting geometry for the 
gradient minimization:</strong></span>&nbsp; Have a look at the file 
&lt;file&gt;_30p0_average.mop, this is the "best guess" for the starting point for 
refining the transition state. If the starting structure for gradient 
minimization does not look correct, the failure likely 
occurred in the gradient minimization, so use a GUI to examine the geometry.&nbsp; 
If the geometry does not look like the transition state for the reaction, 
carefully examine the reactants and products to verify that the reaction is the 
one that was intended.</p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style2">Alternative gradient minimization methods:</span></strong>&nbsp; 
If the starting structure for gradient minimization looks correct, but the 
transition state did not refine correctly, try refining the transition state by 
alternatively minimizing the heat of formation while holding the atoms in the 
transition state fixed and minimizing the gradient of the atoms in the 
transition state while holding all other atoms fixed.&nbsp; This can be done in 
a single run, but requires more human effort to set up the data set correctly.&nbsp;
