<h1 align="center">MOPAC utility program "JOIN"</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">Program "JOIN" is a utility for joining together two 
parts of a reaction coordinate trajectory created using the Dynamic Reaction Coordinate, 
<a href="drc0.html">DRC</a>, the 
Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate, <a href="irc0.html">IRC</a>, or a
<a href="/Manual/point.html">reaction path</a>. These trajectories can be modeled using 
JSmol.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Only the Windows version of JOIN is available.&nbsp; To 
install JOIN download "<a href="Join.zip">JOIN</a>" and place the 
executable in a location where you keep other .exe files. If that folder is not 
in the PATH, add a short file named JOIN.cmd file to a folder that is in the 
PATH, this file should contain a single line of the type "<strong>C:\Users\yourname\location 
of JOIN\JOIN.exe&nbsp; %1&nbsp; %2</strong>" </p>
<p class="auto-style1">JOIN is run at the command-prompt level, in the folder 
that contains the arguments.&nbsp; If JOIN is 
run without any arguments, it will print a brief message describing what it can 
do.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style2"><strong>One argu<a name="One_argument"></a>ment:</strong></span> Quite often a trajectory needs to be 
reversed.&nbsp; For example, a reaction coordinate is normally written as going 
from a reactant over a transition state to a product, and the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
of the product is lower than that of the reactant.&nbsp; The reactant is usually 
on the left of the graph and the product on the right.&nbsp; If a trajectory is 
calculated, and the positions of the reactant and products are reversed, then 
the reaction path can be reversed using Join.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1">JOIN can be used to create a multi-step reaction, i.e., 
one where a reactant goes over a transition state then down to an intermediate 
that has a higher energy than the reactant, then the intermediate goes over a 
transition state to a lower-energy product.&nbsp; In the first reaction, the 
left-right convention is reversed, so that the intermediate (with a &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
higher than that of the reactant) is on the right of the graph. If the graph is 
the wrong way round, it can be reversed using JOIN.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">In all cases, the original trajectory is over-written.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><strong><span class="auto-style2">Two ar<a name="Two_arguments"></a>guments:</span>
</strong>When two arguments are used, the trajectory specified by the second 
argument is attached to the end of the trajectory specified by the first 
argument. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style1">The output from JOIN when the two arguments are used is 
named "new.xyz"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If JSmol had been installed, see
<a href="/Manual/README_for_JSmol.html">instructions</a>, 
then the new reaction path can be animated. A worked example of such an
<a href="Individual%20JSmol%20paths/new/new.html">animation</a> is included in 
the ZIP file</p>
<h2><span class="auto-style2">Notes</span> </h2>
<h3>Suggested procedure for building a multi-step Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate 
reaction path</h3>
<p><strong>First</strong>, generate all the transition states, then use <a href="irc.html"><tt>IRC=1*</tt></a> 
to generate the reaction coordinate for each reaction step.&nbsp; Here are the 
steps needed for each IRC calculation:</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Run a <a href="force.html"><tt>FORCE</tt></a> calculation to work out the reaction coordinate, 
and use keyword <a href="isotope.html"><tt>ISOTOPE</tt></a> to store the force matrix.&nbsp; This will be used in 
each of the IRC calculations. This step does not need to be done if the system 
is small and runs fast.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Set up an IRC job, using the same geometry and same name as that used 
in the FORCE calculation. Use keyword <tt>IRC=1*</tt> if the system is small 
enough to run in a reasonable time.&nbsp; If it is big, make up two jobs, one 
with <tt>IRC=1 </tt>and one with <tt>IRC=-1,</tt> the results of these two 
half-path jobs 
can be joined together to give the same results as <tt>IRC=1*</tt>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style3">If the <tt>FORCE</tt> calculation had been done, then add keyword <a href="restart.html"><tt>RESTART</tt></a>, this will 
read in the FORCE matrix, which will be used in generating the reaction 
coordinate normal mode required by <tt>IRC=1</tt>. </p>
<p class="auto-style3">Decide on a suitable step-size, e.g.,
<a href="x-priority.html"><tt>X-PRIORITY=0.2</tt></a>.&nbsp; This step-size should be 
used for all parts of a reaction path.&nbsp; It should not be changed for any 
step, if it is changed any resulting animation or graph will be distorted. </p>
<p class="auto-style3">A useful option at this point is to include 
<a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
This will result in a simple HTML web-page being constructed that can be used 
to verify that the correct path is being generated.&nbsp; A common fault is that 
both the forward <tt>IRC=1</tt> and reverse <tt>IRC=-1</tt> paths are the same, 
this typically occurs when the potential energy surface at the top of a barrier 
is relatively flat. An easy way to ensure that the paths are correct is to add
<a href="kinetic.html"><tt>KINETIC=20</tt></a>.&nbsp; This shifts the starting 
point for the IRC path a significant distance in the appropriate direction&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style3">To minimize the chance of artifacts being created by 
insufficient precision, add keyword <a href="precise.html"><tt>PRECISE</tt></a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Add
<a href="cycles.html"><tt>CYCLES=10000</tt></a> to ensure that long IRC's can be 
created.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">If the behavior of the dipole during a reaction is of 
interest, add <a href="dipole.html"><tt>DIPOLE</tt></a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If all the keywords just described were used, then the keyword set would 
consist of "<strong>IRC=1* HTML X-PRIORITY=0.2 CYCLES=10000 PRECISE KINETIC=20 
RESTART DIPOLE</strong>"</p>
<p>Give the jobs for the various trajectories simple descriptive names, such as 
"start.mop", "Step-2.mop", "end.mop", etc. These 
will produce trajectories that have names ending in .xyz, e.g., start.xyz.&nbsp; Don't use long names - that would 
just result in more work typing then in when using JOIN. </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, optimize the geometry at the end of each path.&nbsp; IRC paths 
terminate before the exact stationary point is reached because the forces acting 
on the atoms become so small that the IRC starts to wander erratically.&nbsp; To 
include the exact stationary point, a very short path, consisting of a single 
geometry, must be made.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Edit an IRC path, to isolate a terminal geometry, then 
use that as a starting point for a normal geometry optimization.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">This geometry optimization should use keywords PRECISE 
and HTML.&nbsp; Again, check that the resulting geometry looks correct.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">In the data-set, after the geometry, add a second 
calculation using keywords <a href="oldgeo.html"><tt>OLDGEO</tt></a><tt> IRC CYCLES=1</tt> and, 
optionally <tt>DIPOLE</tt>. This will generate the stationary point in the path 
format.&nbsp; Remember: short names are preferred. Run that job.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, start to join the various parts together. These should be joined in 
the order in which they occur in the reaction path.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">If half-paths were used, then join up all matching 
half-paths to form a full path of the type 1*, i.e. the energy goes from a 
minimum to a transition state to a second minimum. Both half-paths include a 
point representing the transition state, so edit one of the half-paths to delete 
the first model; this is the transition state. Then <a href="#One_argument">reverse</a> the half-path 
that would come before the other half path, finally <a href="#Two_arguments">join</a> the two parts using 
JOIN. </p>
<p class="auto-style3">Start with the stationary point at the beginning and the 
first path.&nbsp; Join these together using a command of the type: <strong>JOIN 
exact-start path-1</strong>&nbsp; This will generate a new file named new.xyz 
that has the two trajectories joined together.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Examine the file new.xyz by running new.html (this file 
is included in the JOIN zip file) If it looks correct, rename it as, e.g., 
start-path-1.xyz.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Join the new path to the stationary point at the end of 
the first path, e.g. <strong>JOIN start-path-1 exact-intermediate-1</strong>.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Examine the new file new.xyz, and if it looks correct, 
rename it as, e.g., start-path-1-int-1.xyz.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Join the new path to the next path, e.g., <strong>JOIN 
start-path-1-int-1 path-2</strong> , check that it's correct, the re-name it as, 
e.g., <strong>start-path-1-int-1-path-2.xyz</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style3">Continue adding stationary points and path segments until 
the entire trajectory is constructed.</p>
<p>This sequence is obviously quite tedious to carry out, and it would need to 
be run several times, so as soon as a step is done correctly, put the command 
into a Windows command script.&nbsp; An example of such as script is:</p>
<p><strong>REM<br/>REM Generate whole of reaction path for heats<br/>REM<br/>
JOIN "Exact start" "IRC for axial chair - boat"<br/>if exist 
"axial-TS1.xyz" del "axial-TS1.xyz"<br/>rename new.xyz "axial-TS1.xyz"<br/>REM<br/>
JOIN&nbsp; "axial-TS1" "Exact middle"<br/>if exist 
"axial-TS1-intermediate.xyz" del "axial-TS1-intermediate.xyz"<br/>rename new.xyz 
"axial-TS1-intermediate.xyz"<br/>REM<br/>JOIN&nbsp; 
"axial-TS1-intermediate" "IRC equatorial chair - boat"<br/>if exist 
"axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2.xyz" del "axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2.xyz"<br/>rename 
new.xyz "axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2.xyz"<br/>REM<br/>JOIN e 
"axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2" "Exact end"<br/>if exist 
"axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2-equatorial.xyz" del 
"axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2-equatorial.xyz"<br/>rename new.xyz 
"axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2-equatorial.xyz"</strong></p>
<p>This will simplify construction of the whole path, and reduce the probability 
of making a typographic error.</p>
<h3>Excel</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office program Excel can be used for making graphs that are 
suitable for publication.&nbsp; The starting point for this is a file that holds the 
entire trajectory.&nbsp; A list of the heats of formation for the various points 
can then be extracted from the trajectory file using Windows "find" command.&nbsp; 
For example, if the trajectory is named <strong>
axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2-equatorial.xyz</strong>, then a file containing the 
heats of formation can be generated using:</p>
<p>f<strong>ind "HEAT" axial-TS1-intermediate-TS2-equatorial.xyz &gt; bits.txt</strong></p>
<p>The file bits.txt can then be used in Excel.&nbsp; Two useful operations 
within Excel are (1) Add a column, <strong>Reaction coordinate</strong>, 
containing the reaction coordinate in &Aring;ngstroms (the Profile number minus 
one times the step-size defined in X-PRIORITY=<em>n.nn</em>), and (2) add a 
column, <strong>Heat</strong>, containing the heats of formation minus the 
lowest heat of formation, normally the last point in the trajectory.&nbsp; By 
plotting <strong>Heat</strong> against <strong>Reaction coordinate</strong>, a 
traditional potential energy profile graph can be made.</p>
<h3>How the joins are performed</h3>
<p>Normally there will be a small miss-match in the geometries at the end of one 
trajectory and the start of the next trajectory.&nbsp; To prevent a 
discontinuity, the size of the miss-match is evaluated, and using the step-size, 
a number of new points are added.&nbsp; Typically this would be one to six 
points.</p>
<p>The orientation of the geometry of the system at the end of one trajectory 
would normally be different to that at the start of the next trajectory.&nbsp; 
Because orientation is not important from a chemistry perspective, the geometry 
at the start of the second trajectory is rotated and translated to minimize the 
distance between the it and the final geometry in the first trajectory.&nbsp; 
This rotation and translation is then applied to every point in the second 
trajectory.</p>
<p>A consequence of this operation is that only the geometries in the first 
trajectory are those calculated by MOPAC, all the rest are rotated and 
translated.</p>
<h3>Distances between points on a trajectory</h3>
<p>Two types of distance are used in describing reactions. One is the distance 
in terms of the IRC.&nbsp; To calculate this, the difference in Profile number 
of the two points, typically stationary points, either stable minima or 
transition state geometries, is evaluated and then multiplied by the step-size 
defined in X-PRIORITY=<em>n.nn.&nbsp; </em>This would be the same as the 
distance in the Excel chart.&nbsp; The other distance would be the straight-line 
distance between the two geometries.&nbsp; Distances of this type should all be 
calculated using geometries taken from the same trajectory file; do <em>not</em> 
use any of the geometries that were used in making the trajectory file.&nbsp; Convert each 
geometry of interest into a data-set, and use keywords <strong>1SCF HTML</strong>, 
then run the job using MOPAC.&nbsp; Distances between pairs of points can then 
be calculated using data sets containing the following instructions:&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><a href="compare.html">COMPARE</a> <a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a>="First 
geometry.arc" +<br/><a href="geo_ref.html">GEO_REF</a>="Second geometry.arc" <br/>
Compare "First geometry" and "Second geometry" </strong> </p>
<p>The ARC files contain the heat of formation of the system.&nbsp; This is 
useful for checking that the correct geometry is being used.&nbsp; A concise summary of the differences would be given in the HTML file 
generated by that run. By definition, all distances calculated using the IRC 
would be equal to or greater than the equivalent straight-line distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of a piece of string is always equal to or greater than the distance 
between its ends.</p>
