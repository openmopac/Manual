<p>For this calculation, the bond-lengths and angles can be assumed. Unless instructed <em>not</em> to do so, MOPAC will automatically optimize the geometry. For this system, the data set is as shown in Figure 2.<br/>

As can be seen, the first three lines are textual. The first line consists of keywords (here four keywords are shown). These control the calculation. The next two lines are comments or titles. The user might want to put the name of the molecule and why it is being run on these two lines. 
<p>Lines one through three are obligatory. If no name or comment is wanted, leave blank lines. If no keywords are specified, leave a blank line. A common error is to have a blank line before the keyword line: this error is quite
difficult to find, so be careful not to have four lines before the start of the geometric data (lines 4-9 in the example). Whatever is decided, the three lines, blank or otherwise, are obligatory. </p>
<p>The next set of lines defines the geometry. In the example, the numbers are all neatly lined up; this is not necessary, but does make it easier when looking for errors in the data. The geometry is defined in lines 4 to 9; line 10 terminates both the geometry and the data-file. Any additional data, such as symmetry data, would follow line 10. </p>
<p>At any point in the data set, one or more comment lines can be introduced; these are identified by the presence of an asterisk (*) as the first character on the line.&nbsp; 
Comments are most often put before the first line of the data set (before Line 
1), in which case they are printed in the .arc file and in the PDB file if&nbsp; <a href="pdbout.html">
<tt>PDBOUT</tt></a> is used, however, they can be anywhere, including in or after the Z-matrix, 
but these comments will not be printed in the .arc file. Comments are ignored by 
the calculation. They are useful when one or more atoms are to be 
excluded from a specific calculation.&nbsp; By adding an asterisk to the start 
of an atom-line, the atom is excluded; by removing its asterisk, an excluded atom 
can then be put back in to the calculation easily.</p>
