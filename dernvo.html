<tt>DERNVO</tt> </h1>
<p>
Print some of the working in subroutine DERNVO. DERNVO works out contributions 
to the gradients of the Cartesian&nbsp; coordinates arising from the open-shell 
RHF wavefunction.&nbsp; Quantities printed are:</p>
<p>
*&nbsp; CARTESIAN DERIVATIVES DUE TO FROZEN CORE: This is RO-UHF equivalent to the material 
printed by <tt> <a href="dcart.html">DCART</a></tt>.<br/>
*&nbsp; RESIDUAL ERROR: If the Cartesian derivatives are calculated correctly, 
then the sum of the gradients in "x", "y", and "z" will be zero&nbsp; The 
difference from zero is a measure of the error in the Cartesian derivatives due 
to the frozen core.</p>
<p>
*&nbsp; CARTESIAN DERIVATIVES DUE TO RELAXING CORE: This is the contribution to 
the Cartesian derivatives arising from the C.I. terms only. <br/>
*&nbsp; RESIDUAL ERROR: If the Cartesian derivatives due to the relaxing core 
are calculated correctly, then the sum of the gradients in "x", "y", and "z" 
will be zero&nbsp; The difference from zero is a measure of the error in the 
Cartesian derivatives due to the relaxing core.</p>
<p>
*&nbsp; CARTESIAN DERIVATIVES FROM ANALYTICAL C.I. CALCULATION The sum of the 
frozen plus relaxing contributions (the total derivative due to the 
wave-function)<br/>
*&nbsp; RESIDUAL ERROR: The errors in the calculation of the sum of the frozen 
plus relaxing contributions to the total derivative due to the wave-function.&nbsp; 
Ideally, these should be zero.</p>
