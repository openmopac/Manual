Note on Theory</h1>
<p align="left">
Most of the theoretical material used in MOPAC is given in the
<a href="theory.html">theory section</a>.&nbsp; This section gives a description 
of the ideas, concepts, equations, and approximations used in MOPAC.&nbsp; A 
careful examination of these will provide enough information to allow a user to 
understand the methods used in MOPAC.</p>
<p align="left">
With only a few exceptions, the derivation of the theoretical concepts is not 
given because almost all the derivations are readily available in the 
literature.&nbsp; The only exceptions are for equations or concepts that are not 
well described in the literature, of these the most important is the
<a href="Overlap_integrals.html">overlap integral</a> over atomic Slater 
orbitals.&nbsp; Some features of the output, a good example being State 
eigenvectors that involves the <a href="Atomic_states.html">3J symbol</a>, are 
also described.&nbsp; On the whole, though, the theory section has been written 
with the intention of describing the theory used in MOPAC, and it is left to the 
reader to find out how the current state of the theoretical concepts came to be.</p>
