<tt>MACRO</tt> </h1>
<p>In large molecules such as proteins atoms that are separated by a large 
distance, say 10 Angstroms or more, the NDDO approximation is not used, instead 
the only interaction that is used is the electrostatic energy arising from the 
atomic partial charge.&nbsp; This makes the jobs run faster.</p>
<p>If <tt>MACRO</tt> is not used, then in large molecules the transition from NDDO to 
simple electrostatic point-charge is sudden.&nbsp; This discontinuity introduces 
errors in the derivatives, that in turn cause problems for the optimizers.&nbsp; 
The purpose of MACRO is to smooth the transition from NDDO to point-charge, so 
that the derivatives are not significantly affected. One side-effect of using 
MACRO is that the heat of formation is changed.&nbsp; This change is not large, 
but is large enough to possibly cause problems with projects are are currently 
underway (August, 2020).</p>
<p>To avoid problems, add <tt>MACRO</tt> to all large jobs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Use of a keyword of this type is not a good solution to the problem.&nbsp; A 
better solution would be to make the MACRO smoothing function an intrinsic part 
of all future methods.</p>
