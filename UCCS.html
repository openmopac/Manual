<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">Modeling proteins</font></h1>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">Proteins and their properties can be modeled using MOPAC2016.&nbsp; 
Until now, there have only been two methods for studying proteins: experiment 
(X-ray structures and biochemical experiments) and understanding (knowledge of 
biochemistry and of the behavior of proteins).&nbsp; The methods and utilities in 
MOPAC2016 provide a tool for modeling proteins and their reactions.&nbsp; This 
is fundamentally different from experiment and understanding, in that it 
provides a method for investigating protein behavior and for testing ideas, and 
as a result of the increase in accuracy of prediction of protein behavior  in 
recent years, the computer model is now a practical and 
reliable intellectual tool.&nbsp; If experimentalists can be persuaded that this 
new tool would be useful to them, then its use for studying proteins would 
amount to a paradigmatic change in the field of biochemistry.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">For the purposes of 
investigating protein behavior, it is useful to regard the program MOPAC as a 
complete laboratory, with all the utilities and tools needed for modeling 
protein behavior.&nbsp; As with tools in any laboratory, a certain level of 
skill is needed; a potential user who just wants to look at an enzyme-catalyzed 
reaction and is not willing to prepare a suitable model will inevitably be 
disappointed.&nbsp; Potential users must be willing to do two things: first, to 
acquire the skills necessary for manipulating the complicated models, and 
second, to construct and use such models.&nbsp; These are difficult tasks, and a 
lot of patience is required.&nbsp; To help with them, MOPAC provides a set of 
utilities to assist in building models and for detecting errors that occur 
during this process.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">Why should an 
experimentalist use computational chemistry modeling tools?&nbsp; Probably the 
most important reason is that they provide an alternative to the other two 
approaches: experiment and understanding.&nbsp; To give a simple example, 
consider an X-ray structure of a protein.&nbsp; This structure is physics, not 
chemistry, and almost all (well over 90%) of the structures looked at thus far 
have had mild to severe errors when looked at from a chemical point of view.&nbsp; 
Examples would be unrealistic single bond lengths, e.g., C-C bonds of length 
~1.1</font><font face="Arial"> &Aring; instead of the expected 1.5 &Aring;,
unrealistic non-covalently bonded distances, and simple errors such as a C-NH<sub>2</sub> 
being mistaken for a C=O and <i>vice versa</i>. These errors can be detected 
using MOPAC, and, more important, they can be corrected.&nbsp; The result is a 
structure that is much more chemically realistic than the starting PDB 
structure.&nbsp; Put another way, the result of simply building a model of a 
protein is a structure that is more realistic, i.e., nearer to the structure of 
the biochemical that occurs in nature, than anything available from any other 
source. </font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">To reiterate, for a model to be useful it must be realistic.&nbsp; When an 
enzyme catalyzes a reaction, the energy changes involved are often very small, 
frequently less than the energy involved in making a single hydrogen bond.&nbsp; If there is a fault 
in the model that might cause it to be in a high-energy state, and later on in 
the simulation that fault corrected itself, the resulting energy change would 
more than likely invalidate all the work that had gone before.&nbsp;It is 
important, therefore, to make sure that the starting model is as error free as 
possible.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, and without exception, all data sources for protein structures 
(in particular, the most important one: the Protein Data Bank) have limitations.&nbsp; These range from minor 
faults - ones that were previously regarded as unimportant - such as missing 
hydrogen atoms, to quite severe geometric errors, such as carbon-carbon single 
bonds having a bond-length of less than 1.1
&Aring;ngstrom.&nbsp; Therefore, before any work can be done, a realistic model of the 
protein must be constructed.&nbsp; This operation involves several steps, and 
requires great care to be exercised to ensure that the resulting model is as 
good as possible. </font></p>
