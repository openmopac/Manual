Recommended folder names
</h1>
<p>Although it is obvious that the names of folders for computational chemistry 
projects do not affect the results, researchers are advised to chose names that 
make it easier to navigate inside a project.&nbsp; To this end, the following 
suggestions are made for working on projects that involve proteins:</p>
<h2>Top folder</h2>
<p>This should define the project so if the project involves working with a PDB 
file named &quot;1ABC&quot;, then the the top folder should be named &quot;1ABC&quot; or &quot;1ABC 
Mechanism&quot; or &quot;1ABC PM7 Mechanism&quot; or something similar.&nbsp; When this is 
done, finding the project is relatively easy.&nbsp; Once inside the top-level 
folder, the project's name should not be used.&nbsp; Folder and file names 
should be as short as possible and should clearly indicate what is inside, so if 
the name of the project is in the folder name, there is no need to repeat it in 
the files and sub-folders.</p>
<h3>Contents of Top Folder</h3>
<p>Suggested names for a starting set of sub-folders are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Literature:</b> Reprints, original un-edited PDB files, research notes, 
  correspondence, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Sandbox </b>or<b> Work:</b> A folder for testing ideas.&nbsp; The 
  contents of this folder should be regarded as temporary.&nbsp; As soon as 
  something works, it should be moved to another folder, and the folder emptied, 
  so it's ready for the next idea.</li>
  <li><b>Preparing Starting Model</b>: All the steps involved in constructing 
  the starting model.&nbsp; If the globule model is used, see &quot;<a name="Construction" href="Use%20of%20a%20globule.html#Construction">Construction 
  of starting Globule system</a>.&quot;</li>
  <li><b>Starting model: </b>A single-point calculation of the geometry of the 
  starting system.&nbsp; This would be based on the results of &quot;Preparing 
  Starting Model.&quot;</li>
  <li><b>Preparing Intermediate Model: </b>All the steps involved in 
  constructing an intermediate model.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Intermediate Model: </b>A single-point calculation of the geometry of 
  the intermediate.&nbsp; This would be based on the results of &quot;Preparing 
  Intermediate Model.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If JSmol is used, and its use is strongly recommended, then the jsmol folder 
should be in the top folder, and, to prevent it being accidentally deleted, 
should be hidden.&nbsp; The presence of this folder is essential for activating 
web-pages created by <a href="html.html">HTML</a>.</p>
