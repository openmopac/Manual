 Charge Balanced Unit Cells</a>
</h2>
<p>
Obviously, the net charge in a unit cell is zero.  A less obvious need is for
the dipole of the unit cell to be as small as possible.  Consider the highly
artificial system:
</p><p>
</p><pre>+     +     +     +     +     +     +     +
                        -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -
                        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
                       / \   / \   / \   / \   / \   / \   / \   / \
                      /   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_/   \_
                      A                           C D                B
</pre>
<p>
This system represents a simple hydrocarbon backbone with anionic sites
covalently bound.  The anionic charge is balanced by cation counterions.
However, although there is one cation for each anion, and the unit cell is
uncharged, the unit cell does have a large dipole.
</p><p>
Why is this undesirable?   For the purpose of this discussion, let
<tt><a href="cutofp.html">CUTOFP</a></tt> be infinite.  Then electrons in atom <i>A</i> would be stabilized by
every cationic charge and destabilized by every anionic charge.  With
increasing distance the effect of the cations and anions would more-or-less
cancel out.  However, at large distances an asymmetry in the charge
distribution is introduced.  To the left of <i>A</i> there would be 8 anions and 12
cations, while to the right of <i>A</i> there would be 16 anions and 12 cations.
The potential effect of this asymmetry would be a net positive potential at
<i>A</i>.  Similarly, at <i>B</i> there would be a net negative potential arising from
the charges.
</p><p>
As a result of the Born-von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n periodic boundary conditions, atom
<i>A</i> is bonded to atom <i>B</i>.  Because of the symmetry of this system, <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> should have the same charge (roughly zero), but because of the large unit cell
dipole, there will be an induced dipole in the bond <i>A</i>-<i>B</i>.  There will be
induced dipoles in all bonds of the <i>A</i>-<i>B</i> type, for example <i>C</i>-<i>D</i>, but
these will be very small compared to that in the <i>A</i>-<i>B</i> bond.
</p><p>
The overall effect of this induced bond dipole is that the molecular geometry
in  the region of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is deformed.  In a correctly optimized system,
the effect of having a large dipole in the unit cell is to induce gradient
effects at the ends of the unit cell.
</p><p>
To avoid these effects, the unit cell should be chosen in such a way as to make
the dipole of the unit cell as small as possible.  For most systems, the
default value of <tt>CUTOFP</tt> used by the program will prevent this problem
from occurring.
