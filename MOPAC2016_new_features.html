<h1 align="center">
New Features and Improved Features in MOPAC2016 </h1>
<p class="auto-style2">A new version of MOPAC will be released in early 2016; 
this version will be named MOPAC2016.&nbsp; There will be increased focus on 
biochemical applications, in particular in modeling proteins.&nbsp; Although 
MOPAC2012 was able to model biomolecules efficiently, its use for this task was 
limited by the difficulties involved in constructing data-sets.&nbsp; In 
particular, there were only a small number of tools in MOPAC2012 for 
manipulating PDB files or structures resulting from MOPAC calculations.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The new MOPAC2016 will have several new tools for 
examining, comparing, and modifying macromolecules; some will be ready when 
MOPAC2016 is released, others are still being written.&nbsp; These tools should 
make research into biochemical processes using MOPAC much easier, and, in turn, 
should result in a greater usage of the large compute engine in MOPAC.&nbsp; 
Several worked examples were used during the development of these tools in order 
to find weaknesses in the procedures.&nbsp; As a result, the new methods for 
manipulating systems have become more robust and intuitive.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Here is a list of the more important new features and 
functionalities in MOPAC</p>

<p class="auto-style2">Automatic conversion of a raw PDB file into a MOPAC data set. Any 
		existing hydrogen atoms are removed and new hydrogen atoms added, then 
		the atoms are re-sequenced to put them into standard PDB form.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p class="auto-style2">Automatic re-arrangement of atoms when 
		comparing pairs of PDB structures.&nbsp; When two files that represent 
		the same structure are compared, the atoms in the second file are 
		re-arranged so as to minimize the RMS difference.&nbsp; An option exists 
		to allow structures that have some, but not all, atoms in common to be 
		compared.</p>
</td>
<td class="auto-style1" style="width: 124px">
<p class="auto-style2"></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="auto-style2">Three new metrics are provided when comparing structures.&nbsp; (1) 
		Individual atoms that are in different positions in the two structures 
		are identified along with the distance between the two positions. A 
		maximum of 30 such atoms are reported. (2) Interatomic distances that 
		are different in the two structures are printed.&nbsp; A maximum of 25 
		distances are reported. (3) Hydrogen bonds present in one structure but 
		not in the other, together with H-bond length and the energy, are 
		printed.&nbsp; All such hydrogen bonds that are less than 3.0&nbsp;&Aring; 
		and have a stabilization greater than 0.8 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> are 
		printed.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">New global properties for comparing structures 
		are: (A) The total non-covalent energies. (B) The number of hydrogen 
		bonds common to both systems. (C) The total, average, and RMS difference 
		between the two geometries.</p>
