<tt>PDBOUT</tt>
</h2>
&nbsp;<tt>PDBOUT</tt> will cause the geometry to be 
printed in PDB format. Although the format printed is designed to match that 
used in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the agreement is not always exact.&nbsp;<p>
If atomic partial charges have been calculated, these will be printed in columns 
61-66 for each atom.&nbsp; In the PDB format, these are the columns used for the 
temperature factor.&nbsp; The atomic partial charges can be viewed using&nbsp; 
JSmol if <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> is present.</p>
<p>
By default, the residue sequence will be that supplied by the data set.&nbsp; To 
re-calculate residues, use
<tt> <a href="residues.html">RESIDUES</a></tt>; that will ignore the residue 
names supplied by the data set, and re-calculate them using the topology of the system. 
If this option is used, check that the new residue names are acceptable.&nbsp; 
To do this, look in the output file for the section:</p>
<p>If the 
data set includes comments (lines that start with an asterisk (*)) followed by 
PDB words such as HEADER, TITLE, COMPOUND, REMARK, etc., these will be printed in the PDB format.&nbsp; This 
is very useful in preserving the integrity of the PDB file.</p>
<p>If residues are missing, or if multiple proteins are present, keyword <tt>
<a href="start_res.html">START_RES(<i>text</i>)</a></tt> should be used to 
indicate this. By default, each chain, or section of chain, will be given a 
different letter, starting with "A".&nbsp; This can cause problems, particularly 
if a chain has a gap in it, because, by default, MOPAC would give the two chain sections 
different letters.&nbsp; Chain letters can be explicitly assigned by using
<tt><a href="chains.html">CHAIN(text)</a></tt>.&nbsp; These keywords are 
automatically generated when a PDB file is read in and a MOPAC data set 
generated.</p>
<p>If hydrogen atoms have been added, these will automatically be put in their 
correct place in the PDB file, unless <a href="noreseq.html"><tt>NORESEQ</tt></a> 
is present.</p>
<p>Except for hydrogen atoms, atom labels will not be changed. Label names for 
hydrogen atoms will be based on the atom the hydrogen is attached to.&nbsp; This 
makes proton migrations easier to identify.</p>
<p>A fast way to convert a data-set from MOPAC to PDB format is to use <tt>
<a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a></tt> and <tt>PDBOUT.</tt> Also, if a restart 
file, &lt;file&gt;.res, is present, adding <tt>RESTART </tt>to the data set will 
read in the updated geometry and, if <tt>
0SCF</tt> and <tt>PDBOUT</tt> are also both present, will immediately print the 
current geometry in PDB format.</p>
