<h1 align="center"> Editing Macromolecules </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems involved in editing macromolecules are different from those 
involved in editing small molecules.&nbsp; In small systems an edit normally 
involves only a few atoms being moved, added, or deleted.&nbsp; Such operations 
can easily be done using a GUI that has editing capability.&nbsp; When 
macromolecules need to be edited, the number of atoms that are modified can 
reach into the hundreds, this makes editing much more difficult.&nbsp; In an 
attempt to make this task easier, three very different methods have been 
developed.&nbsp; The choice of which one to use to edit a particular system 
depends on what needs to be done and on the system.&nbsp; The following 
descriptions provide a guide to making this choice:</p>
<p>"Cut and Paste" following a GEO_REF 0SCF HTML run</p>
<p>Use of JSmol's "MINIMIZE" function to correct errors.</p>
<p>Use of CVB to correct errors in starting structure</p>
