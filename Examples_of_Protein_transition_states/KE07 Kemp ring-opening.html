In this reaction, the heterocyclic ring in 5-nitro-benzisoxazole opens to form a 
cyanide or nitrile group and a hydoxyl anion.&nbsp; This reaction does not occur 
in nature because the heterocyclic ring substrate is highly strained.&nbsp; That strain is 
relieved when the ring opens, so the reaction is, for all practical purposes, irreversible. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">Locating the transition state for the 
		re-arrangement involves the following steps:<br>
</p>
<h2>Adding hydrogen atoms (File: &quot;3CSM Add-H.mop&quot;)</h2>
<p>PDB file 3CSM does not include hydrogen atoms, so the first step is to 
hydrogenate the system.&nbsp; Keywords in this file are:</p>
<p><strong>GEO_DAT=&quot;3CSM.pdb&quot;:</strong>&nbsp; For convenience the original PDB 
file is not edited, instead it is added to the run using this keyword.&nbsp; If 
the data-set &quot;3CSM Add-H.mop&quot; had a fault, the data-set could be edited easily 
and the integrity of the original PDB file would not be compromised.</p>
<p><strong>CHAINS=(A):</strong>&nbsp; 3CSM is dimeric but only one of the two 
systems is needed.&nbsp; By using this keyword, all atoms of system &quot;A&quot; are 
selected, and all atoms of system &quot;B&quot; are excluded.</p>
<p><strong>ADD_H: </strong>Hydrogen atoms are added so as to neutralize all 
sites.&nbsp; This operation is almost always used together with a SITE keyword, 
this changes the hydrogenation of various sites so that the system is more 
realistic.</p>
<p><strong>
SITE=(salt,&quot;[ARG]157:A.NH2&quot;(+),&quot;[TSA]400:A.O2&quot;(-),&quot;[GLU]44:A.OE1&quot;(0),&quot;[HIS]47:A.ND1&quot;(0),&quot;[TSA]400:A.O3&quot;(-),&quot;[ARG]16:A.NH2&quot;(+),&quot;[TSA]400:A.C6&quot;(-),&quot;[TSA]400:A.C8&quot;(-)):
</strong>This really big keyword adds and deletes hydrogen atoms as necessary to 
make a realistic system.&nbsp; In order, the <a href="../site.html">SITE</a> 
arguments used are:</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>SALT:</strong> Make all reasonable
<a href="../salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a> between residues.</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>&quot;[ARG]157:A.NH2&quot;(+),&quot;[TSA]400:A.O2&quot;(-): </strong>
Make a salt bridge between a residue and the substrate (the substrate is not a 
residue, so SALT would not make this salt bridge.)</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>&quot;[TSA]400:A.O3&quot;(-),&quot;[ARG]16:A.NH2&quot;(+): </strong>
The same as&nbsp; &quot;[ARG]157:A.NH2&quot;(+),&quot;[TSA]400:A.O2&quot;(-).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>&quot;[GLU]44:A.OE1&quot;(0),&quot;[HIS]47:A.ND1&quot;(0): </strong>
Not critical.&nbsp; This salt bridge was created automatically, but both 
residues are on the surface, and it looks as if they are solvated.</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>&quot;[TSA]400:A.C6&quot;(-),&quot;[TSA]400:A.C8&quot;(-): </strong>
This dehydrogenation is important and interesting.&nbsp; The main difference 
between TSA and chorismate or prephenate is that TSA has two extra hydrogen 
atoms.&nbsp; When TSA was hydrogenated, the correct structure for TSA was 
produced.&nbsp; To convert this TSA structure into the chorismate or prephenate, 
two hydrogen atoms need to be deleted.&nbsp; These arguments do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HTML: </strong>Not essential, but very useful in deciding where to 
add or delete hydrogen atoms. HTML produces a JSmol web-page that can be opened 
using NETSCAPE.&nbsp; Individual atoms to be used in the SITE keyword can easily 
be identified in this web-page.&nbsp; A useful trick is to start editing the 
SITE keyword and hover the cursor over the appropriate atom in the web-page.&nbsp; 
That displays the JSmol label, which can then be typed in the SITE keyword.&nbsp; 
If the PDB label is available, that can be used.
</p>
<p><strong>NOCOMMENTS:</strong>&nbsp; Suppress all PDB HEADER, TITLE, COMPOUND, 
SOURCE, etc., remarks.</p>
<p><strong>OUTPUT: </strong>Suppress all voluminous output.</p>
<p>Run &quot;3CSM Add-H.mop&quot; and edit the resulting ARC file, as follows:</p>
<h2>Making the Chorismate and Prephenate systems</h2>
<p>Edit &quot;3CSM Add-H.arc&quot; to replace</p>
<p><strong>START_RES=(1A-222 300A-400) chains=(A) HTML output</strong></p>
<p>with</p>
<p><strong>START_RES=(1A-222 300A-400) chains=(A) HTML Opt mozyme eps=78.4 gnorm=5 
output charge=0 t=2w </strong>
</p>
<p>These are the keywords for an unconstrained global optimization of a system 
in aqueous media.&nbsp; Normally there would be an intermediate step in which 
the positions of the hydrogen atoms would be optimized, but as this is a very 
simple reaction, this step is not necessary.</p>
<p>Starting with &quot;3CSM Add-H.arc&quot; use an editor to move the O7 in the substrate 
away from C5, i.e., deliberately break the C5-O7 bond. Save the resulting 
structure as &quot;3CSM Chorismate.mop&quot;
</p>
<p>Starting with &quot;3CSM Add-H.arc&quot; use an editor to move the C9 in the substrate 
away from C1, i.e., deliberately break the C9-C1 bond. Save the resulting 
structure as &quot;3CSM Prephenate.mop&quot;
</p>
<h2>Optimizing the geometry of the Chorismate and Prephenate systems</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">Run both &quot;3CSM Chorismate.mop&quot; and &quot;3CSM Prephenate.mop&quot; 
These jobs take a long time, typically a few days, so a useful strategy is to 
run both of them at the same time on a machine that is dedicated to running long 
jobs.</p>
