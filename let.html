<tt>LET, LET(<i>nnn</i>)</tt> </h1>
<p>As MOPAC evolves, the meaning of <tt>LET</tt> is changing.</p>
<p>Now <tt>LET</tt> means essentially "I know what I'm doing, override safety checks".</p>
<p>Currently, <tt>LET</tt> has the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.In a <tt><a href="force.html">FORCE</a></tt> calculation, it means that the supplied geometry is to be used, even if the gradients are large.</dt>
<dt>2.<a name="BM2402">&nbsp;</a>In a geometry optimization, the specified <tt>
<a href="gnorm.html">GNORM</a></tt> is to be used, even if it is less than 0.01.</dt>
<dt>3.In a <tt><a href="polar.html">POLAR</a></tt> calculation, the molecule is to be orientated along its principal moments of inertia before the calculation starts. <tt>LET</tt> will prevent this step being done.</dt>
<dt>4.In a EF calculation, allow the
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> to rise. Obviously, the
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> should decrease on every step, but 
sometimes, particularly with very flat potential energy surfaces, motion in 
response to the gradients might not result in a decrease in energy.&nbsp; By 
using <tt>LET</tt>, small increases in
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> are allowed.&nbsp; This will allow the 
gradient minimum to be reached.&nbsp; This is a well-defined point, whereas the 
minimum in energy is not, so in this case the use of <tt>LET</tt> is justified.&nbsp; 
Note that the use of<tt> LET</tt> will not result in motion to a different 
minimum.<br/>5. When comparing protein geometries, it means that hydrogen atoms 
that would otherwise not be paired up, because they are on different residues, 
are in fact paired up.<br/>6. In a <a href="Locate-TS.html"><tt>LOCATE-TS</tt></a> 
calculation, do not perform a comparison of the reactants and products.&nbsp; 
Useful only with small systems where the use of PDB labels can cause problems.<br/>
7. In a <a href="lbfgs.html"><tt>LBFGS</tt></a> calculation, the default number of cycles used in identifying the 
lowest-energy geometry is increased from 30 to 60.&nbsp; Other values can be set 
using <tt>LET(<i>nnn</i>)</tt>, where "<i>nnn</i>" is the number of cycles to be used instead of 60.</dt>
