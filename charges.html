<tt>CHARGES</tt>
</h1>
<p align="left">When <tt>CHARGES</tt> is present, all ionized sites in the system will be identified and printed.&nbsp; 
The run will then be stopped.&nbsp; This operation is useful during the 
preparation of a data set, in that it is very easy for even experienced users to 
have incorrect charges on large systems, particularly complicated organic 
species such as enzymes and organometallics.</p>
<p align="left">The method for identifying charged atoms is very powerful.&nbsp; 
So although you might be quite certain that you have the charges correct, if 
<tt>CHARGES</tt> indicates that you have made a mistake, please check the system using 
the information printed.&nbsp; In 100% of the cases where users have complained 
that MOPAC reported faulty charges, <tt>CHARGES</tt> identified errors in the user's structure.</p>
<p align="left">In MOPAC, many common Lewis structures involve hypervalent systems 
being represented as ions.&nbsp; Thus the sulfur atom in sulfuric acid would be represented as 
S<sup>+</sup> and there would be a counter-charge of O<sup>-</sup>.&nbsp; Be aware that 
during a geometry optimization "<a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a>" can 
form, e.g. -COOH
<sup>...</sup>&nbsp; H<sub>2</sub>N-&nbsp; can convert to -[COO]<sup>-</sup>
<sup>...</sup>&nbsp; [H<sub>2</sub>N]<sup>+</sup>-. Such structures should <i>
not</i> be regarded as faults. Also, metal ions might be reported as having an 
unexpected charge, thus Zn with four oxygen atoms as ligands might be reported 
as [Zn]<sup>2-</sup>. If this causes any concern, add keyword
<a href="metal.html">METAL</a>, and all bonds to metal ions will be broken, so 
for example Zn with four ligands would be reported as [Zn]<sup>2+</sup> and all 
four ligands would each acquire a negative charge.</p>
<p align="left">The choice of which nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle in 
histidine have attached hydrogen atoms is often not immediately obvious.&nbsp; 
But in many cases, the choice is important - the wrong choice will always result 
in a high-energy structure, and be accompanied by severe rotation of the 
heterocycle, as it tries to relieve the stress.&nbsp; <tt>CHARGES</tt> cannot 
help with identifying the right choice.</p>
