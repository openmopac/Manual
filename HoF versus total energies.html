<h1 align="center">Heats of Formation <em>versus</em> Total Energies</h1>
<p>Ab-initio and semiempirical 
												methods represent the energy of 
												a chemical system in two 
												different ways.&nbsp; Ab-initio 
												methods use a quantity called 
												the "total energy", and 
												semiempirical methods use the 
												Heat of Formation.&nbsp; 
												These quantities can be defined 
												as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Total Energy (TE)</strong> is the energy, in atomic units (Hartrees) 
released when the chemical system is formed from the constituent atomic nuclei 
and electrons.&nbsp; The zero of energy is the isolated atomic nuclei and 
isolated electrons.&nbsp; Ab-initio methods model the system at zero Kelvin, (0 K).&nbsp; 
No zero point energy, vibrational or translational terms are included in the TE. 
See <a href="http://gaussian.com/faq1/">Gaussian FAQ</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Heat of Formation (&Delta;H</strong><sub><strong>f</strong></sub><strong>)
</strong>is the change in enthalpy, in kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> or kj mol<sup>-1</sup>, when one mole of a system is formed from its elements, with 
everything being in its standard state, i.e., at 298.15 K and one atmosphere of 
pressure.&nbsp; See <a href="SCF_calc_hof.html">HoF from SCF</a>.</p>
<p>Semiempirical methods are parameterized using reference data for chemical 
systems in their standard state.&nbsp; Because the reference data represent 
systems at 298.15 K, any Zero Point Energy and all internal energy terms (vibrational, rotational, and 
translational -contributions) are automatically taken into account in the 
parameters, see <a href="thermochemistry.html#SECTION0012153000000000000000">Note on 
Thermochemistry</a>.&nbsp; 
If the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> at a different temperature is needed, the internal 
energy at 298.15 K must be deleted, and the internal energy at the specified 
temperature added.&nbsp; The resulting quantity is the change in enthalpy, in 
kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, when one mole of a system at the specified temperature 
and one atmosphere of pressure is formed from its elements in their standard state, i.e., at 298.15 K and one atmosphere of 
pressure.&nbsp; This can be done using keyword <a href="thermo00.html"><tt>THERMO</tt></a>.</p>

</table>
<p>Semiempirical reference data includes all quantum and classical 
phenomena, therefore Zero Point Energies are automatically present, and do not need 
to be included in the calculation of &Delta;H<sub>f</sub>.&nbsp; Calculation of 
the ZPE and internal energy can be done using the <a href="thermo00.html"><tt>THERMO</tt></a> 
keyword. Energies of formation of atoms can be done one at a time, using 
individual atoms; look for "ELECTRONIC ENERGY". If this is done, take care to 
specify the correct ground state of the isolated atom. </p>
<p>Energy of atomization of elements is the experimental heat of formation of the
isolated atom from the element in its standard state. For example, in nitrogen
this is half the heat required to break a N<sub>2</sub> molecule into its
separated atoms. Isolated nitrogen atoms have the configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>
2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>3</sup>, and the state <a href="Energies_of_isolated_atoms.html">4S<sub>u</sub></a>, 
i.e. quartet S. Experimentally, this energy is 113 kcal/mol.&nbsp; This means 
that all semiempirical methods predict the heats of formation of isolated atoms 
with a zero error, except in those few instances when the predicted ground state 
is incorrect.</p>
<h2>Which is better: Heats of Formation or Total Energies?</h2>
<p>The choice of which quantity to use depends on what it is to be used for, 
thus &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> are useful for practical chemistry work, and TE are useful 
for theoretical chemistry work. Why is this?&nbsp; All reactions are, by 
definition, balanced, so the difference in the choice of starting point for the 
energy calculation - whether nuclei plus 
electrons or elements - would cancel out.&nbsp; What would not cancel would be 
the zero point energy and internal energy needed to heat the system from 0 K to 
the specified temperature, typically 298.15 K.&nbsp; To the degree that these 
energies are important, if Total Energies are used, then post-SCF corrections must be made.&nbsp; 
These corrections do not need to be made in semiempirical methods, because they 
are already accounted for in the parameters.&nbsp; </p>
