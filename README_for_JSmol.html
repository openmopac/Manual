Instructions for using remote files that contain Jmol and for installing Jmol for use with MOPAC</h1>
<p>
<br>Both remote and local HTML files made using MOPAC were tested using Firefox (other browsers - Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Chrome were 
also tested but none of them worked). For remote HTML files generated by MOPAC, 
use the browser Firefox.&nbsp; Simply click on the file and it should open 
correctly.</p>

<h2>
Installing JSmol</h2>
<p class="auto-style1">
Download the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/latest/download?source=files", target="_parent">
latest Jmol distribution</a> and extract the jsmol.zip file.&nbsp; Extract the 
contents of jsmol.zip and put them in a location 
where they can be used.&nbsp; A suitable location would be on the same level as 
the MOPAC projects being worked on, so if you have a project in the folder 
.../Users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects/Project_1, then unpack the ZIP file at the 
level&nbsp;&nbsp; .../Users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects to form a new folder&nbsp; 
.../Users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects/jsmol. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">
Download <a href="JSmol_examples.zip">JSmol_examples.zip</a> and extract the contents to a folder at the same level as 
the folder jsmol.&nbsp; If jsmol is in .../Users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects 
then extract the contents to .../Users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects/JSmol_examples</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
The folder jsmol contains everything that is needed for displaying HTML JSmol 
files.<br>The folder JSmol_examples contains examples of files that can be 
generated by MOPAC. These files have been edited to show certain features. New 
HTML files made by MOPAC will be much simpler than the ones here. </p>
<p class="auto-style1">
Before proceeding further, run a test to verify that jsmol is working.&nbsp; To 
do this, open the folder jsmol and double click on the file Keto-Enol.html.&nbsp; 
This should open a normal internet window that contains text.&nbsp; If this does 
not happen, change the settings for files ending in .html to open, use Firefox 
only.&nbsp; Once the window opens, there will be a short pause until the 
JSmol window appears, this should contain a picture of a protein.&nbsp; When the 
JSmol window appears, this test is complete.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
Rather than copy files from the various projects into the folder jsmol, it is 
easier to keep the files in the individual projects and to refer to the files in 
jsmol.&nbsp; Go into JSmol_examples, and try to open Keto-Enol.html.&nbsp; Most 
likely it will not open.&nbsp; If that happens, and you see brown and yellow 
letters flickering in the bottom left corner of the window, then a small change needs to be made to the browser to allow 
the browser to use the files in jsmol.&nbsp; This change involves 
changing a security switch from TRUE to FALSE. </p>
<h2>
Opening a HTML file</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to open a HTML file made by MOPAC is to double-click the HTML 
file. Test this method by opening one of the HTML files in the folder 
JSmol_examples.&nbsp; This should open it with Firefox. If this does not happen, 
set the default for opening HTML file to Firefox.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">
An alternative, if Firefox is already open, is to use the File =&gt; Open file 
option in Firefox.&nbsp; To test this, go into JSmol_examples and open any HTML 
file. This should open a web-page containing text and a graphics window.
</p>
<h2>
Using JSmol with MOPAC</h2>
<p>
Edit a MOPAC data set in one of your projects to add keywords
<a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a>, then run that 
file.&nbsp;
This should make two new files, one with the suffix .html, and one with a suffix 
of the type .pdb, .xyz, or .mgf.&nbsp; Open the .html file.&nbsp; The script 
files can be edited outside the browser, they cannot be edited inside the 
browser.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Keyword <tt>HTML</tt> can be used in subsequent jobs, but each run will create a 
new HTML file.&nbsp; If the old file was edited, it will be overwritten.&nbsp; 
The HTML file refers to scripts &quot;Common Script&quot; and &quot;Specific Script&quot; that runs 
plain-text files, these script 
files will not be overwritten.</p>
<h2>
Tidying up</h2>
<p>
When JSmol is working correctly, a final set of tasks can be carried out.&nbsp; 
These are: hiding the folder jsmol so that it will not be seen in a directory 
explorer window, and (in Mac and Linux systems) making a soft link to jsmol.</p>
<h3>
Hiding the folder jsmol - Windows</h3>
<p>
Right-click on the folder jsmol. Select Properties. Click on Hidden, Click on 
&quot;Apply changes to this folder only.&quot;&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<h3>
Hiding the folder jsmol - Mac</h3>
<p>
At the command prompt level, type &quot;chflags hidden /users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects/jsmol&quot;</p>
<p>
To undo this, at the command prompt level, type &quot;chflags nohidden /users/&lt;yourname&gt;/MOPAC_Projects/jsmol&quot;</p>
<p>
Do not type the quotation marks.</p>
<h3>
Symbolic links</h3>
<p>
<strong>Mac:</strong> If you want the folder jsmol to be used by different projects at 
different levels, and don't want to copy the folder (it gets messy fast) at each level go up one folder and make a soft link to jsmol 
using. e.g., &quot;ln -s ../jsmol jsmol&quot; or &quot;ln -s /users/&lt;yourname&gt;/jsmol jsmol&quot;&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any simple way to hide the alias in 
Finder.</p>
<p>
<strong>Linux:</strong> Should be like Mac</p>
<p>
<strong>Windows:</strong> Use mklink</p>
