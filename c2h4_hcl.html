<h1>Addition of HCl to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub></h1>
<p>The method used is AM1, although other methods could, of course, be used.&nbsp;
The calculations described here do not depend on the method used.</p>
<h4 align="center">Description of Reactants:<img align="right" border="0" height="93" src="c2h4_h2.gif" width="198"/></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Ethylene and hydrogen chloride form distinct species separated by a
large distance.<br/>
&nbsp;The H-Cl distance is 1.283 Angstroms.&nbsp; <font face="Symbol">D</font>H<sub>f</sub>
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>: +16.45 Kcal/mol; <font face="Symbol">D</font>H<sub>f</sub>
HCl: -24.61 Kcal/mol;<font face="Symbol"> D</font>H<sub>f</sub> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>
+ HCl: -8.19 Kcal/mol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="center">Description of Transition State:<img align="right" border="0" height="97" src="c2h4_h3.gif" width="102"/></h4>
<p>The H -- Cl distance has increased to 1.630 Angstroms, <br/>
the H -- C distance is 1.424 A, and the Cl -- C distance is 2.268 Angstroms.
<font face="Symbol">D</font>H<sub>f</sub>: +34.84 Kcal/mol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="center">Description of Products:<img align="right" border="0" height="75" src="c2h4_h1.gif" width="83"/></h4>
<p>In Chloroethylene, the C-H distance is 1.117 Angstroms, the C-Cl distance is
1.758 A, <br/>
and the H -- Cl distance is 2.932A.&nbsp; <font face="Symbol">D</font>H<sub>f</sub>
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl: -26.19 Kcal/mol.</p>
<p align="left">Use of a <a href="grid_calc.html">GRID </a>to generate the
transition state:</p>
<p align="left">
<img align="right" border="0" height="134" src="c2h4_h5.gif" width="178"/>An obvious, and incorrect, way to find the transition state
would be to generate the potential energy surface map in which one direction
represented the C -- H stretch and the other represented the C -- Cl stretch.&nbsp;
In this map, the C - H distance is varied from 1.1 to 1.7 A, and the C - Cl
distance is varied from 2.0 to 2.6 Angstroms.&nbsp; The resulting map shows an obviously incorrect structure in the region of the transition
state, in that the ridge is quite sharp..&nbsp; Examination of the geometries in the region of the transition state
showed that two distinct types of structure: (a) a product-like structure in
which the H -- Cl distance was large, and (b) a reactant-like structure, in
which the H -- Cl distance was small.&nbsp; At no point was the H -- Cl distance
similar to that in the transition state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conclusion to be
drawn was that the map did not include geometries related to the transition
state, despite the fact that geometries intermediate between reactants and
transition state, and geometries intermediate between transition state and
product were generated.</p>
<p align="left">However, by using these intermediate geometries, one from each
side of the transition state, a <tt><a href="saddle.html"><u><font color="#0000ff">SADDLE</font></u></a></tt>
calculation can be run, to generate a good approximation to the transition
state.&nbsp; This can then be further refined using <a href="ts.html"><tt><font color="#0000ff"><u>TS</u></font></tt></a>,
and finally the transition state could be characterized using <a href="force.html"><tt><font color="#0000ff"><u>FORCE</u></font></tt></a>.</p>
<p align="left">Here, the starting points for the SADDLE calculation were
obtained from the output from the GRID or map calculation.&nbsp; If such a
calculation had not been done, the SADDLE calculation could have been started
using the reactants and products only.&nbsp; The difference would have been that
the SADDLE calculation would have taken longer to run.</p>
<p align="left">Note that in the Markovnikov reaction, the first step is
addition of Cl(.) to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, followed by addition of HCl to
the resulting C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl.&nbsp; This gives rise to the
product, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + Cl(.).</p>
